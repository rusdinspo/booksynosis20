In 1582 he and his clairvoyant partner Edward Kelley made magical contact with a number of spiritual entities who identified themselves as angels&#x2015;the same that communicated with Enoch and the patriarchs of the Old Testament. Over the next 3 years they revealed to Dee and Kelley three distinct magical systems of vision magick. The third and last of these incorporated a series of &#x201c;calls&#x201d; to be recited in an angelic language in order to raise the consciousness of the magician to a level where angelic contact is possible.</p><p>In <i>Enochian Vision Magick</i>, Lon Milo DuQuette introduces the origins of Enochian magick and offers the expert and novice alike the opportunity not only to see the big picture of the full system but also the practical means by which he or she can become attuned in the same step-by-step manner that first prepared Dee and Kelley.</p><p>First published by Weiser in 2008, this new edition includes a new introduction and new back matter by the author as well as a new foreword by Jason Louv.</p><p>Replaces ISBN 978-1-57863-382-1</p></p><p><b>Lon Milo DuQuette</b> is a bestselling author and lecturer on such topics as magick, tarot, and the Western Mystery Traditions.

But why are some nations more creative than others, and why do some highly innovative societies--such as ancient China, or Britain in the industrial revolution--pass into stagnation?<br> Beginning with a fascinating, concise history of technological progress, Mokyr sets the background for his analysis by tracing the major inventions and innovations that have transformed society since ancient Greece and Rome. What emerges from this survey is often surprising: the classical world, for instance, was largely barren of new technology, the relatively backward society of medieval Europe bristled with inventions, and the period between the Reformation and the Industrial Revolution was one of slow and unspectacular progress in technology, despite the tumultuous developments associated with the Voyages of Discovery and the Scientific Revolution.<br> What were the causes of technological creativity? Mokyr distinguishes between the relationship of inventors and their physical environment--which determined their willingness to challenge nature--and the social environment, which determined the openness to new ideas. He discusses a long list of such factors, showing how they interact to help or hinder a nation's creativity, and then illustrates them by a number of detailed studies taken from the history of Europe and China. He examines such aspects as the role of the state (the Chinese gave up a millenium-wide lead in shipping to the Europeans, for example, when an Emperor banned large ocean-going vessels), the impact of science, as well as religion, politics, and even nutrition. He questions the importance of such commonly-cited factors as the spill-over benefits of war, the abundance of of natural resources, life expectancy, and labor costs. And he presents startlingly novel explanations of why China lost its dramatic lead in technology to Europe, why medieval Europe was technologically more creative than Classical Antiquity, and why Britain left the rest of the world behind during the Industrial Revolution only to lose its leadership a century later.<br> Today, an ever greater number of industrial economies are competing in the global market, locked in a struggle that revolves around technological ingenuity. <em>Lever of Riches</em>, with its keen analysis derived from a sweeping survey of creativity throughout history, offers telling insight into the question of how Western economies can maintain, and developing nations can unlock, their creative potential.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>Joel Mokyr</strong> is Professor of Economics and History at Northwestern University, and is the author of <em>Why Ireland Starved</em>, <em>The Economics of the Industrial Revolution</em>, and other books in economic history.<br>"An excellent volume outlining in great detail, yet wide ranging in scope, the role of technological change in history. Will make a great supplemental text for our future World Economic History course that I'll be teaching."--Michael Haupert, Univ. of Wisconsin-LaCrosse<br><br>"Mokyr has demonstrated, yet again, that he is one the best economic historians around. His book is a treasure trove of facts and insights about technological progress often overlooked in other accounts.

Elizabeth Wilson covers the composer's life from his early successes to his struggles under the Stalinist regime, and his international recognition as one of the leading composers of the twentieth century. She builds up a detailed picture of Shostakovich's creative processes, how he was perceived by contemporaries, and of the increased contrast between his private life and public image as his fame increased.</p><br><p> This new edition, produced to coincide with the centenary of Shostakovich's birth, draws on many new writings on the composer. In doing so, it provides both a more detailed and focused image of Shostakovich's life and a wider view of his cultural background. In particular, Shostakovich's sardonic and witty sense of humor reveals itself in many of his letters to close friends. Shostakovich offers fascinating insight into the complex personality and musical life of this great composer, and examines his position as one of the major figures in the cultural life of twentieth-century Russia.</p></p><p><b>Elizabeth Wilson</b>, a cellist and Russianist, studied at the Moscow State Conservatory with Mstislav Rostropovich between 1964 and 1971.

Sympathetic yet balanced, Michael White's <i>Isaac Newton</i> offers a revelatory picture of Newton as a genius who stood at the point in history where magic ended and science began.</p><p>Science writer Michael White's subtitle, <i>The Last Sorcerer</i>, echoes John Maynard Keynes's assertion in 1942 that Isaac Newton (1642-1727) was not the Olympian rationalist portrayed by his worshipful early biographers. Newton was a great scientist, the author acknowledges; he was also an "obsessive, driven mystic," deeply involved in the pseudoscience of alchemy, subscriber to a heretical sect of Christianity, and damaged survivor of childhood traumas that rendered him a difficult, egotistical, quarrelsome adult. White makes recent research accessible to the general reader in lucid prose that knocks the academic dust off a towering historical figure.<b>Michael White</b> was a science lecturer and director of studies at d&#x2019;Overbroeck&#x2019;s College, Oxford for ten years before becoming a full-time writer and journalist.

A worldwide bestseller since its publication in 1978, Irving's classic is filled with stories inside stories about the life and times of T. S. Garp, novelist and bastard son of Jenny Fields--a feminist leader ahead of her time. Beyond that, <b>The World According to Garp</b> virtually defies synopsis.<br><br>----"Nothing in contemporary fiction matches it," said critic Terrence Des Pres. "Irving's blend of gravity and play is unique, audacious, almost blasphemous. . . . Friendship, marriage and family are his primary themes, but at that blundering level of life where mishap and folly--something close to joyful malice--perpetually intrude and disrupt, often fatally. Life, in Irving's fiction, is always under siege." Time magazine commented: "Irving's popularity is not hard to understand. His world is really the world according to nearly everyone."<br><br>----This Modern Library edition includes a new Introduction by the author.<br><br>The Modern Library has played a significant role in American cultural life for the better part of a century. The series was founded in 1917 by the publishers Boni and Liveright and eight years later acquired by Bennett Cerf and Donald Klopfer. It provided the foundation for their next publishing venture, Random House. The Modern Library has been a staple of the American book trade, providing readers with affordable hardbound editons of impor-tant works of literature and thought. For the Modern Library's seventy-fifth anniversary, Random House redesigned the series, restoringas its emblem the running torchbearer created by Lucian Bernhard in 1925 and refurbishing jackets, bindings, and type, as well as inaugurating a new program of selecting titles. The Modern Library continues to provide the world's best books, at the best prices.</p><p>"Garp was a natural storyteller," says the narrator of John Irving's incandescent novel, referring to the book's hero, the novelist Garp, who has much in common with Irving himself. "He could make things up one right after the other, and they seemed to fit."<p> Irving packs wild characters and weird events into his classic--officially recognized as such in a Modern Library edition with a new introduction by the author--while amazingly maintaining the rough feel of realism in every scene and the pulse of life in every heart. Many novelists of his time might have populated a novel with a novelist protagonist whose life and books comment on each other and the novel we're reading. Transsexual football players, ball turret gunners lobotomized in battle, multiple adultery, unicycling bears, mad feminists who amputate their tongues in sympathy with the celebrated victim of a horrifying rape--Irving made them all people. Even the bear is a fitting character. </p><p> In a crucial episode, Garp's wife's seduction of a young man coincidentally occurs at the moment when Garp is delighting their young sons with a reckless car trick (one of the few scenes beautifully, eerily, heartbreakingly captured in the film version as well). Many authors would have been content with the harsh comedy of the scene, but Irving respects its integrity, and he builds the rest of the book on the consequences of the event. How does he get away with his killer cocktail of slapstick and horror? Because it's simply what we all face daily, rearranged into soul-satisfying art. "Life is an X-rated soap opera," according to Garp, and who can contradict him?</p><p> Rereading <i>Garp</i> 20 years later, one is struck by how elegantly Irving structures his bizarre and complex story. Take the two most celebrated bits in the book, the Under Toad and Garp's story "<i>The Pension Grillparzer,</i>" which shimmers like an exquisite Kafkaesque insect in the amber of the novel. When Garp warns his son about the "undertow" at the beach, the boy imagines a monster out of <i>Beowulf</i> who lurks beneath the waves to suck you under: the "Under Toad." It's funny at first, but we soon find that the Under Toad is a metaphor with teeth--he connects with a prophetic dream of death in "The Pension Grillparzer," set in Vienna. Garp's son's last words are, "It's like a dream!" And as Irving--who studied at the University of Vienna--can certainly tell you, the German word for "death" sounds precisely like the English word "toad."</p><p> All that death, and yet Garp is mainly exuberant. This story is, as Garp's stuttering writing teacher puts it, "rich with lu-lu-lunacy and sorrow." It enriches literature, and our lives. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>To be honest, I never read John Irving before I read A Widow For One Year. But after I finished Widow, I went on a John Irving reading frenzy. I read A Prayer for Owen Meany, The 158 Pound Marriage, The Water-Method Man, and The Cider House Rules.<br><br>Then I fell in love with Garp.<br><br>When John Irving agreed to read the new introduction to The World According to Garp for our new Unabridged AudioBook, we were thrilled. He would record in New York, on a Wednesday morning, but needed a ride to the studio. Could anyone give him a lift?<br><br>Please. I jumped at the chance.<br><br>As we talked about Garp and the pending publication of A Widow for One Year, I suddenly realized I've been sitting in New York City traffic for the last 30 minutes with John Irving.

Beginning with their own research in motor, perceptual, and cognitive development, Thelen and Smith raise fundamental questions about prevailing assumptions in the field. They propose a new theory of the development of cognition and action, unifying recent advances in dynamic systems theory with current research in neuroscience and neural development. In particular, they show how by processes of exploration and selection, multimodal experiences form the bases for self-organizing perception-action categories.</p><p>Thelen and Smith offer a radical alternative to current cognitive theory, both in their emphasis on dynamic representation and in their focus on processes of change. Among the first attempt to apply complexity theory to psychology, they suggest reinterpretations of several classic issues in early cognitive development.</p><p>The book is divided into three sections. The first discusses the nature of developmental processes in general terms, the second covers dynamic principles in process and mechanism, and the third looks at how a dynamic theory can be applied to enduring puzzles of development.</p><p><i>Cognitive Psychology series</i></p></p><p>Esther Thelen was Professor of Psychology and Cognitive Science at Indiana University before her death in 2004.<br><br>Linda B.

Among the greatest works of world literature, this prodigious narrative, composed by the poet Ferdowsi in the late tenth century, tells the story of pre-Islamic Iran, beginning in the mythic time of creation and continuing forward to the Arab invasion in the seventh century. The sweep and psychological depth of the&nbsp;<i>Shahnameh</i>&nbsp;is nothing less than magnificent as it recounts classic tales like the tragedy of Rostam and Sohrab.<br><br>Now Dick Davis, &#x201c;our pre-eminent translator from the Persian&#x201d; (<i>Washington Post</i>), presents a comprehensive translation of Ferdowsi&#x2019;s masterpiece in an elegant combination of prose and verse, allowing the poetry of the<i>Shanameh&nbsp;</i>to sing its own tales directly, interspersed sparingly with clearly-marked explanations to ease along modern readers.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world.

In its pages, the 11th-century poet Abolqasem Ferdowsi chronicles the reigns of a hundred kings, the exploits of dozens of epic heroes and the seemingly never-ending conflict between early Iran and its traditional enemy, the country here called Turan (a good-sized chunk of Central Asia). To imagine an equivalent to this violent and beautiful work, think of an amalgam of Homer's Iliad and the ferocious Old Testament book of Judges.<p> But even these grand comparisons don't do the poem justice. Embedded in the Shahnameh are love stories, like that of Zal and Rudabeh, that recall the heartsick yearnings of Proven�al troubadours and their ladies; tragedies of mistaken identity, hubris and irreconcilable moral obligations that might have attracted Sophocles; and meditations on the brevity of life that sound like Ecclesiastes or Horace. Though ostensibly historical, the poem is also full of myth and legend, of fairies and demons, of miraculous births and enchanted arrows and terrible curses, of richly caparisoned battle-elephants and giant birds straight out of the Arabian Nights. Little wonder that artists have often taken its stories as the inspiration for those manuscript illuminations we sometimes call Persian miniatures.</p><p>All this is swell, a modern reader is likely to think, but can Americans living in the 21st century actually turn the pages of the Shahnameh with anything like enjoyment? Yes, they can, thanks to Dick Davis, our pre-eminent translator from the Persian (and not only of medieval poems, but also of Iraj Pezeshkzad's celebrated comic novel, My Uncle Napoleon). Davis's diction in this largely prose version of the Shahnameh possesses the simplicity and elevation appropriate to an epic but never sounds grandiose; its sentences are clear, serene and musical. At various heightened moments -- usually of anguish or passion -- Davis will shift into aria-like verse, and the results remind us that the scholar and translator is also a noted poet:</p><p>Our lives pass from us like the wind, and why Should wise men grieve to know that they must die?</p><p>The Judas blossom fades, the lovely face Of light is dimmed, and darkness takes its place.</p><p>The world is pleasure first, then grief, and then We leave this fleeting world of living men -- Our beds are dust, for all eternity, Why should we plant the tree we'll never see?</p><p>Many of the episodes of the Shahnameh clearly draw from the same teeming ocean of story known to Western poets and mythmakers. Old King Feraydun divides greater Persia into three realms, one for each of his sons, and the two older brothers conspire against the youngest, with bloody centuries-long consequences. The champion Rostam boldly undertakes seven Herculean trials. Kay Kavus's entire army is scourged with blindness by the White Demon. A heroic warrior meets his own valiant and unrecognized son on the field of battle (English majors will remember this as the subject of Matthew Arnold's poem "Sohrab and Rustum"); Kay Khosrow fasts and meditates, like Buddha, and then renounces the throne and earthly vanity to ascend into heaven. There's even an example of that misogynistic favorite about the high-ranking older woman (Potiphar's wife, for instance, or Phaedra) who lusts after a forbidden younger man, in this case her stepson: "Now when the king's wife, Sudabeh, saw Seyavash, she grew strangely pensive and her heart beat faster; she began to waste away like ice before fire, worn thin as a silken thread." But, as in Racine, Ferdowsi makes us feel the middle-aged Sudabeh's torment:</p><p>"But look at me now," she implores Seyavash. "What excuse can you have to reject my love, why do you turn away from my body and beauty? I have been your slave ever since I set eyes on you, weeping and longing for you; pain darkens all my days, I feel the sun itself is dimmed. Come, in secret, just once, make me happy again, give me back my youth for a moment."</p><p>The story of Seyavash is a study in conflicting loyalties, like so much of the Shahnameh. The blood relations between Iran and Turan are intricate, as many of the major characters can trace their lineage back to Feraydun, and even traditional enemies occasionally intermarry. In fact, the most common theme of the epic is the tension between fathers and sons, often of kings who don't want to relinquish power and younger men who want to prove they deserve it. Aging Goshtasp can't bear to give up his kingship, even to his own son. So he sends the noble young warrior on an impossible mission: to bring the proud and invincible Rostam back to the court in chains. In truth, there's no good reason for this order, as that hero has long been a loyal defender of one unworthy Iranian king after another. But Esfandyar owes obedience to his father and his sovereign, even as he recognizes the injustice, indeed the senselessness of the command. Worse yet, Rostam admires the young man and so urges every possible escape clause, even agreeing to return to the Persian court -- but not in chains, for he has pledged never to be bound. In the end, two admirable men, caught between mutually opposing vows, must reluctantly meet in armed combat to the death.</p><p>Rostam is a recurrent figure throughout the first half of the Shahnameh. He lives for 500 years, swings his mace like a Middle Eastern Thor, and is usually called upon when times grow truly desperate. When young, Rostam searched for a horse that could support his mammoth size and weight. He finally found Rakhsh, as famous in Persian lore as Pegasus in Greek mythology. What, he asks, is the cost of this formidable animal? The herdsman replies, "If you are Rostam, then mount him and defend the land of Iran. The price of this horse is Iran itself, and mounted on his back you will be the world's savior." </p><p>Rostam also shares, with Odysseus, a liking for sly humor. Once, on a secret mission to a land of sorcerers, people begin to suspect him of being Rostam because of his great strength. He innocently replies: "I don't know if I'm worthy even to be Rostam's servant. I can't do the things he does; he is a champion, a hero, a great horseman." Another time in battle, he seizes an enemy by his belt, which breaks, and the man escapes. Rostam berates himself, "Why didn't I tuck him under my arm, instead of hanging on to his belt?" The old hero finally dies in a trap constructed by his own stepbrother, but not before he uses his last ounce of strength to notch an arrow and send it through the trunk of the tree behind which the murderer thinks he is safe.</p><p>The wily Turanian King Afrasyab is nearly as long-lived as Rostam and somehow manages to escape time and again from certain death. His machinations power much of the first half of the Shahnameh. Afrasyab is nothing if not a Machiavellian realist and one of the most vivid and complex characters in the poem. As a young man, he recognizes the folly of war with Iran's Kay Qobad and so advises his shortsighted father: "War with Iran seemed like a game to you, but this has proven to be a hard game for your army to play. Consider how many golden helmets and golden shields, how many Arab horses with golden bridles, how many Indian swords with golden scabbards, and how many famous warriors Qobad has ruined. And worse than this, your name and reputation, which can never be restored, have been destroyed." He concludes by saying, "Don't think of past resentments, try to be reconciled." The lessons of history, as they say.</p><p> There's much more to the Shahnameh than I've touched on here. Because the poem's geography is largely the Eastern empire, Ferdowsi makes no mention of such famous Persian kings as Darius or Xerxes (though Alexander the Great does appear under the name Sekandar). Instead we learn about figures like Bahram Gur, who enjoyed hunting with cheetahs, once killed a rhinoceros with a dagger and eventually thwarted an invasion by the emperor of China. </p><p>For all their richness, though, long poems sometimes fall prey to a certain repetitiousness, and the wise reader will want to parcel out this one over time. Yet the epic scale of the book shouldn't overshadow its memorable smaller moments, or even some of its single sentences. One beautiful woman's mouth is described as "small, like the contracted heart of a desperate man." A seductive witch appears to Rostam, "full of tints and scents." A king's three daughters, "as lovely as the gardens of paradise, were brought before him, and he bestowed jewelry and crowns on them that were so heavy they were a torment to wear." As Ferdowsi quietly writes, "So the world went forward, and things that had been hidden were revealed." The Shahnameh eventually concludes with the death of the last king of the Sasanian dynasty and the passing of pre-Islamic Iran. Yet the poet can rightly sing:</p><p>I shall not die, these seeds I've sown will save My name and reputation from the grave, And men of sense and wisdom will proclaim, When I have gone, my praises and my fame.</p><p>Thanks to Davis's magnificent translation, Ferdowsi and the Shahnameh live again in English. </p><p>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

Tracing the lives of a group of friends, <i>The Waves </i>follows their development from childhood to youth and middle age. While social events, individual achievements and disappointments form its narrative, the novel is most remarkable for the rich poetic language that expresses the inner life of its characters: their aspirations, their triumphs and regrets, their awareness of unity and isolation. Separately and together, they query the relationship of past to present, and the meaning of life itself.</p><p>Virginia Woolf (1882-1941) is regarded as a major 20th century author and essayist, a key figure in literary history as a feminist and modernist, and the centre of 'The Bloomsbury Group'. This informal collective of artists and writers, which included Lytton Strachey and Roger Fry, exerted a powerful influence over early twentieth-century British culture. Between 1925 and 1931 Virginia Woolf produced what are now regarded as her finest masterpieces, from <i>Mrs Dalloway</i> (1925) to the poetic and highly experimental novel <i>The Waves</i> (1931). She also maintained an astonishing output of literary criticism, short fiction, journalism and biography, including the playfully subversive <i>Orlando</i> (1928) and <i>A Room of One's Own</i> (1929) a passionate feminist essay.</p><p>If you enjoyed <i>The Waves</i>, you might like Woolf's <i>Mrs Dalloway</i>, also available in Penguin Classics.</p><p>'A book of great beauty and a prose poem of genius'<br>Stephen Spender</p><p>'Full of sensuous touches ... the sounds of her words can be velvet on the page'<br>Maggie Gee, <i>Daily Telegraph</i></p></p><p></p><h2>MATHEMATICS: PATHWAYS STUDENT TEXT</h2><p><strong>Presents math skills in a lively format</strong> <p>With <em>Mathematics: Pathways </em>your students will be ready to take the next step in math.

Grant revolutionized military warfare by creating new leadership strategies and by integrating new technologies in classical military strategy. In this compelling biography, Mosier reveals the man behind the military legend, showing how Grant's creativity and genius off the battlefield shaped him into one of our nation's greatest military leaders.</p></p><p><p><b>John Mosier </b>is the author of <i>The Myth of the Great War, </i>and from 1989-1992 he edited the <i>New Orleans Review. </i>As a military historian, he received funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities to develop an interdisciplinary curriculum for the study of the two world wars. He lives in Jefferson, Louisiana.</p>Aside from Grant, the author mentions dozens of military leaders' names without even a parenthetical remark about who they were. Mosier uses the names of Civil War battles without providing any context. He also makes some outrageous statements: "The leading generals of the Civil War were all men of great talent." Brian Emerson has the annoying habit of dropping his voice at the end of sentences, demoting the last word or two to a mumble.

We possess by him political speeches and law-court speeches composed for parties in private cases and political cases. His early reputation as the best of Greek orators rests on his steadfastness of purpose, his sincerity, his clear and pungent argument, and his severe control of language. In his law cases he is the advocate, in his political speeches a castigator not of his opponents but of their politics. Demosthenes gives us vivid pictures of public and private life of his time.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Demosthenes is in seven volumes.The first of the seven volumes of the Demosthenes edition contains nine famous speeches in which he attempted to rouse athenian alarm about Macedonian ambitions: the three <i>Olynthiacs</i>, the four <i>Philippics</i>, <i>On the Peace</i>, and <i>On the Chersonese</i>.

International relations everywhere--and domestic policy in scores of nations--pivoted around this central point, the American-Soviet rivalry. Even today, much of the world's diplomacy grapples with chaos created by the Cold War's sudden disappearance. Here indeed is a subject that defies easy understanding. Now comes a definitive account, a startlingly fresh, clear eyed, comprehensive history of our century's longest struggle. <br> In <em>The Cold War</em>, Ronald E. Powaski offers a new perspective on the great rivalry, even as he provides a coherent, concise narrative. He wastes no time in challenging the reader to think of the Cold War in new ways, arguing that the roots of the conflict are centuries old, going back to Czarist Russia and to the very infancy of the American nation. He shows that both Russia and America were expansionist nations with messianic complexes, and the people of both nations believed they possessed a unique mission in history. Except for a brief interval in 1917, Americans perceived the Russian government (whether Czarist or Bolshevik) as despotic; Russians saw the United States as conspiring to prevent it from reaching its place in the sun. U.S. military intervention in Russia's civil war, with the aim of overthrowing Lenin's upstart regime, entrenched Moscow's fears. Soviet American relations, difficult before World War II--when both nations were relatively weak militarily and isolated from world affairs--escalated dramatically after both nations emerged as the world's major military powers. Powaski paints a portrait of the spiraling tensions with stark clarity, as each new development added to the rivalry: the Marshall Plan, the communist coup in Czechoslovakia, the Berlin blockade, the formation of NATO, the first Soviet nuclear test. In this atmosphere, Truman found it easy to believe that the Communist victory in China and the Korean War were products of Soviet expansionism. He and his successors extended their own web of mutual defense treaties, covert actions, and military interventions across the globe--from the Caribbean to the Middle East and, finally to Southeast Asia, where containment famously foundered in the bog of Vietnam.<br> Powaski skillfully highlights the domestic politics, diplomatic maneuvers, and even psychological factors as he untangles the knot that bound the two superpowers together in conflict. From the nuclear arms race, to the impact of U.S. recognition of China on detente, to Brezhnev's inflexible persistence in competing with America everywhere, he casts new light on familiar topics. Always judicious in his assessments, Powaski gives due credit to Reagan and especially Bush in facilitating the Soviet collapse, but also notes that internal economic failure, not outside pressure, proved decisive in the Communist failure. Perhaps most important, he offers a clear eyed assessment of the lasting distortions the struggle wrought upon American institutions, raising questions about whether anyone really won the Cold War. With clarity, fairness, and insight, he offers the definitive account of our century's longest international rivalry.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ronald E. Powaski</strong> is the author of <em>March to Armegeddon: The United States and the Nuclear Arms Race, 1939 to the Present</em>. He is Adjunct Professor of Special Studies at Notre Dame College of Ohio.<br>Do we need another book on the Cold War? It depends on who you are: If you have been following the voluminous literature over the past couple of decades, then Powaski's book has little new to offer. If, on the other hand, you know next to nothing about the topic and would like a concise summary, then you are in luck, because Powaski (The Entangling Alliance: The United States and European Security, 1950-1993, Greenwood, 1994) has ably gathered the general historiographical issues of this long-drawn-out struggle and packaged them in an easily digestible format. In the enormous library of writings on this subject, Powaski's book is best for slender collections; large libraries already have enough surveys.?Edward Goedeken, Iowa State Univ.

The all-inclusiveness of his volumes on North American birds has made them classics of our time. Published under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution, this historic 20 volume series forms the most comprehensive, most complete, and most-used source of information in existence on the birds of our continent. No ornithologist, conservationist, amateur naturalist or birdwatcher should be without these books. In this volume the reader will find an encyclopedic collection of information about 54 different kinds of marsh bird (flamingo, ibis, bittern, heron, egret, crane, crake, rail, coot, etc.) Not a group of general descriptions but a collection of detailed, specific observations of individual flocks throughout the country, it describes in readable language and copious detail the nesting habits, plumage, egg form, distribution, food, behavior, field marks, voice, enemies, winter habits, range, courtship procedures, molting information, and migratory habits of every known North American marsh bird. <br><br> Completely modern in its approach, this work was prepared with the full recognition of the difficulties inherent in the observation and interpretation of wild life behavior. The author utilized first-hand reports of contemporary observers and writings of America's great naturalists of the past--Audubon, Burroughs, William Brewster. The complete textual coverage is supplemented by 98 full-page black &amp; white plates containing 179 photos of nesting sites, eggs, and the young of important species at various stages in their growth, etc.<br><br> This is an unabridged republication of the first edition.<br></p><p></p><h2>Drawing Geometric Solids: How to Draw Polyhedra from Platonic Solids to Star-Shaped Stellated Dodecahedrons</h2><p>In this book, you will find precise instructions with clear images on how to draw a range of geometric solids.

Featured in this crisply designed volume are five new works from her city-specific series <i>City Sitings</i>, Detroit-related and all created for her exhibition at that city's Institute of Arts. The series references the history of painting while simultaneously mapping multiple, often conflicting, experiences of the urban landscape. Embedded in the seemingly abstract compositions are such referential elements as architectural blueprints and commercial logos. Making use of addition and erasure, Mehretu's process mirrors that of urban change itself. Collapsing the particular energy and history of a city, Mehretu gives the viewer a new perspective on his or her own surroundings.</p><p></p><h2>Plays Well with Others</h2><p>In his widely read, prizewinning Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All, Allan Gurganus gave fresh meaning to an overexplored American moment: 1860-65. He now turns that comic intensity and historical vision to another war zone: entry-level artistic Manhattan 1980-95. In his first novel since Widow, Gurganus offers us an indelible, addictive praise-song to New York's wild recent days, their invigorating peaks and lethal crashes.<br><br>It's 1980, and Hartley Mims jr., a somewhat overbred Southerner, arrives in town to found his artistic career and find a Circle of brilliant friends. He soon discovers both Robert Christian Gustafson, archangelic boy composer of Symphony no. 1: The Titanic, and Alabama Byrnes, a failed Savannah debutante whose gigantic paintings reveal an outsized talent that she, five feet tall, can't always live up to.<br><br>This circle--sexually venturesome, frequently hungry, hooked on courage, caffeine, and the promise of immortality--makes history and most everybody else. Their dramatic moment in New York history might've been a collaboration begun, as a toast, by Cole Porter and finished, as pure elegy, by Poe himself. Plays Well with Others is a fairy tale. It has a Legend's indoctrinating charm and hidden terrors. It chronicles a ragtag group of gifted kids who come to seek their fortunes; they find the low-paying joys of making art and the heady education only multiple erotic partners can provide. Having mythologized each other through the boom years, having commenced becoming "names," they suddenly encounter a brand-new disease like something out of fifth-rate sci-fi. Friends are soon questioning how much they really owe each other; they're left with the ancient consolation of one another's company and help. We watch this egotistic circle forge its single greatest masterwork: a healthy community.<br><br>The novel, a sort of disco requiem-mass, divides itself into three symphonic movements: "Before," "After," and "After After." The work concludes in a homemade paradise that resembles Hartley Mims's own starter vision of all that seemed waiting--latent and convivial--in New York itself.<br><br>This is a work that could've only been written now, in our age of medical advances, written about these unsuspecting unsung heroes of a medieval scourge's first endgame moves among us. Plays Well with Others becomes a hymn to the joys and woes of caretaking (for waning parents and young friends). Allan Gurganus has created a deeply engaging narrative about flawed, well-meaning people who seem lifted from our own address books. His book offers an obsessive love story, a complex vision of our recent past, and an emotional firestorm--a pandemic's long-awaited great novel.</p><p>Allan Gurganus achieved national fame in 1988 for his award-winning <i>Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All</i>. Through this long, garrulous novel, Gurganus retold and explicated almost a century of American history, life, and culture. In <i>Plays Well with Others</i>, Gurganus applies a similar technique to the New York gay art scene in the 1980s, just as AIDS is appearing. Narrated by Hartley Mins, a young artist who "came to New York to write," the novel is an elegiac reminiscence of a culture that, by encouraging personal and sexual freedom, instilled in its artists the ability to create in the face of mortality, love in the midst of loss, and care in a world in which hope is vanishing. Reading <i>Plays Well with Others</i> is a heady experience: its images and emotions spill into our imaginations and lives, forcing us to reexamine how we see the world and how we look at art."[Plays Well With Others] is read by Gurganus in a voice that's a wonderful sort of Southern Harvey Fierstein, the tale is by turns poignant, witty, graphic, hilarious, and even profound . . ." <br>-Providence Sunday Journal<br></p><h2>The Illuminati</h2><p>A secret society has infiltrated the highest offices in the world with the intention of creating a one-world economy, a goal opposed by pastor John Elder and the Constitutional Rights committee who must struggle to free society as well as the growing number of Christians being jailed as terrorists</p><p>Larry Burkett was the founder and president of Christian Financial Concepts, which teaches Biblical principles of money management.

Experts around the world are bracing for a deadly, disruptive pandemic.</p><p>In<i> Pandemic: Tracking Contagions, from Cholera to Ebola and Beyond</i>, prizewinning journalist Sonia Shah reveals how that could happen, by drawing parallels between cholera---one of history&#x2019;s most deadly and disruptive pandemic-causing pathogens---and the new diseases that stalk us today. As Shah traces each stage of cholera&#x2019;s dramatic journey from harmless microbe to world-changing pandemic, she reports on the pathogens that have followed cholera&#x2019;s footsteps---from the MRSA bacterium that besieges her own family to the never-before-seen killers emerging from China&#x2019;s wet markets, the surgical wards of New Delhi, the slums of Port-au-Prince, and the suburban backyards of the East Coast. A true story that is both gripping and alarming, <i>Pandemic</i> delves deep into the convoluted science, strange politics, and the checkered history of one of the world&#x2019;s deadliest diseases, offering a prelude to the future that&#x2019;s impossible to ignore.</p></p><p>Sonia Shah is a science journalist and prizewinning author.

The new edition of Thomas is a return to what Thomas has always been: the book with the best exercises. For the 11th edition, the authors have added exercises cut in the 10th edition, as well as exercises and examples from the classic 5th and 6th editions. The book&#39;s theme is that Calculus is about thinking; one cannot memorize it all. The exercises develop this theme as a pivot point between the lecture in class, and the understanding that comes with applying the ideas of Calculus. In addition, the table of contents has been refined, introducing transcendentals in the first seven chapters. Many of the examples have been trimmed of distractions and rewritten with a clear focus on the main ideas. The authors have also excised extraneous information in general and have made the technology much more transparent. The ambition of Thomas 11e is to teach the ideas of Calculus so that students will be able to apply them in new and novel ways, first in the exercises but ultimately in their careers. Every effort has been made to insure that all content in the new edition reinforces thinking and encourages deep understanding of the material.</p><p>Joel Hass received his PhD from the University of California-Berkeley.

Finding that TFT courses aid students in transfer in ways that other kinds of composition courses do not, the authors demonstrate that the content of this curriculum, including its reflective practice, provides a unique set of resources for students to call on and repurpose for new writing tasks.</p> <p>The authors provide a brief historical review, give attention to current curricular efforts designed to promote such transfer, and develop new insights into the role of prior knowledge in students' ability to transfer writing knowledge and practice, presenting three models of how students respond to and use new knowledge&#x2014;assemblage, remix, and critical incident.</p> <p>A timely and significant contribution to the field, <i>Writing across Contexts</i> will be of interest to graduate students, composition scholars, WAC and writing-in-the-disciplines scholars, and writing program administrators.</p> <p> </p></p><p><p><b>Kathleen Blake Yancey</b>, the Kellogg W.

As he opens the suitcase, the items he finds inside take on a riotously funny life of their own as Dovlatov inventories the circumstances under which he acquired them. A poplin shirt evokes a story of courtship and marriage, a pair of boots calls up the hilarious conclusion to an official banquet, two pea-green cr�pe socks bring back memories of his attempt to become a black-market racketeer, while a double-breasted suit reminds him of when he was approached by the KGB to spy on a Swedish writer. Imbued with a comic nostalgia and overlaid with Dovlatov&#x2019;s characteristically dark-edged humour and wry power of observation, The Suitcase is a profoundly human, delightfully ironic novel from one of the finest satirists of the twentieth century.</p><p>Born to an Armenian mother and a Jewish father, Sergei Dovlatov (1941&#x2013;90) grew up in Leningrad.

Clare Boothe (1903-87) rose from illegitimacy and obscurity by sheer force of brains and sex appeal to become a powerful magazine editor (at <i>Vanity Fair</i>), hit playwright (<i>The Women,</i> 1936), and--by 1940, when this volume ends--budding war correspondent. She married mega-publisher Henry Luce in 1935, but he was one in a lifelong string of men she charmed and used, in author Sylvia Jukes Morris's stinging appraisal.

He was also responsible for implementing Nazi policies towards the Jews in his area - inhumane processes that were the precursors of genocide. Yet he later claimed, like so many other Germans after the war, that he had 'known nothing about it'; and that he had personally tried to save a Jew before he himself managed to leave for military service. A Small Town Near Auschwitz re-creates Udo Klausa's story. Using a wealth of personal letters, memoirs, testimonies, interviews and other sources, Mary Fulbrook pieces together his role in the unfolding stigmatization and degradation of the Jews under his authoritiy, as well as the heroic attempts at resistance on the part of some of his victims. She also gives us a fascinating insight into the inner conflicts of a Nazi functionary who, throughout, considered himself a 'decent' man. And she explores the conflicting memories and evasions of his life after the war. <br><br>But the book is much more than a portrayal of an individual man. Udo Klausa's case is so important because it is in many ways so typical. Behind Klausa's story is the larger story of how countless local functionaries across the Third Reich facilitated the murderous plans of a relatively small number among the Nazi elite - and of how those plans could never have been realized, on the same scale, without the diligent cooperation of these generally very ordinary administrators. As Fulbrook shows, men like Klausa 'knew' and yet mostly suppressed this knowledge, performing their day jobs without apparent recognition of their own role in the system, or any sense of personal wrongdoing or remorse - either before or after 1945. <br><br>This account is no ordinary historical reconstruction. For Fulbrook did not discover Udo Klausa amongst the archives. She has known the Klausa family all her life. She had no inkling of her subject's true role in the Third Reich until a few years ago, a discovery that led directly to this inescapably personal professional history.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mary Fulbrook</strong> is Professor of German History at University College London.

Trusting his remarkable instincts, within less than a year he had built the Royal Poinciana Hotel, and two years later what was to become the legendary Breakers&#x2015;instantly establishing the island as the preferred destination for those who could afford it. Over the next 125 years, Palm Beach has become synonymous with exclusivity&#x2015;especially its most famous residence, &#x201c;Mar-a-Lago.&#x201d; As Les Standiford relates, &#x201c;the high walls of Mar-a-Lago and other manses like it were seemingly designed to contain scandal within as much as keep intruders out.&#x201d;<p>With the authority and narrative prose style that has gained Standiford&#x2019;s work widespread acclaim, <i>Palm Beach, Mar-a-Lago, and the Rise of America&#x2019;s Xanadu</i> tells the history of this fabled landscape intertwined with the colorful lives of its famous protagonists. Flagler&#x2019;s own marriages to Ida Alice Shourds and Mary Lily Kenan perhaps initiated the dramas to come. While sewing machine heir Paris Singer and architect Addison Mizner created the &#x201c;Mediterranean look&#x201d; of Palm Beach in the 1910s, inspiring the building of such modern day palaces as Eva and Ed Stotesbury&#x2019;s &#x201c;El Mirasol,&#x201d; the centerpiece of Palm Beach became the fever dream of Marjorie Merriweather Post and her equally wealthy husband E. F. Hutton, for whom Ziegfeld Follies designer Joseph Urban built &#x201c;Mar-a-Lago&#x201d; in 1927. Marjorie &#x201c;ruled&#x201d; social Palm Beach through two other marriages and for years on her own until her death in 1973. The fate of her mansion threatened to tear apart the very fabric of the town until Donald Trump acquired it in 1985.</p><p>Les Standiford brings alive a fabled place and the characters&#x2015;the rich, famous and infamous alike&#x2015;who have been drawn inexorably to it.</p></p><p><b>Les Standiford</b> is the author of the bestselling <i>Last Train to Paradise: Henry Flagler and the Spectacular Rise and Fall of the Railroad that Crossed an Ocean</i>, <i>Water to the Angels: William Mulholland, His Monumental Aqueduct, and the Rise of Los Angeles</i>, and <i>Meet you in Hell: Andrew Carnegie, Henry Clay Frick, and the Bitter Partnership that Transformed America</i>, among many other works of fiction and nonfiction.

It is a socio-cultural order which, for most of us, reduces our capabilities to function as human beings, our health, our dignity, our sense of self, as well as our resources to act and participate in the world. This book shows that inequality is literally a killing field, with millions of people dying premature deaths because of it. These lethal effects of inequality operate not only in the poor world, but also, and increasingly, in rich countries, as Therborn demonstrates with data ranging from the US, the UK, Finland and elsewhere. Even when they survive inequality, millions of human lives are stunted by the humiliations and degradations of inequality linked to gender, race and ethnicity, and class. <br> <br> But this book is about experiences of equalization too, highlighting moments and processes of equalization in different parts of the world&nbsp;- from India and other parts of Asia, from the Americas, as well as from Europe.

Such has been the popularity and interest in this serene, meditative and mind-stilling song that most music stores now have racks dedicated to Gregorian, medieval and plainchant. Publications in the field have grown proportionately, but as yet there is no single-volume, general guide to Gregorian chant. Professor Crocker&#39;s comprehensive introduction intelligently fills this gap. Accessible to a wide readership, this work is targeted at interested listeners and those who purchase CDs, as well as the practising musician or student. There is no assumption of a technical understanding of music. Blending the conclusions of modern research with a contemporary, popular appreciation of the song, Crocker&#39;s aim is merely to promote greater knowledge and enjoyment of Gregorian chant.</p><p>Richard L.

Young, who cautioned against seeking only the "flowers of consciousness," such as clairvoyance and telepathy, considering them no more than the "intriguing foliage" of psychology. Author Jeffrey Mishlove, however, believes that these and other psychic powers are not just for show, but are "rooted in the essential core of our existence."</p><p>In this thorough book, Young makes the case that, although alien to Western society's ways of thinking, psychic phenomena is deeply embedded within consciousness. He looks at: <br>-- History: studies shamanistic traditions; the ancient civilizations of India, China, Greece, Mesopotamia, and Rome; early Hebrews, Christians, and hermits; and Islamic beliefs and ideas in Medieval Europe, the Renaissance, and the Age of Enlightenment<br>-- Folklore: examines astrology; astral projection and out-of-body experiences; faith healing; auras; communication with angels and other spirits; contact with UFOs and aliens; near-death experiences; mind over matter; and practical applications like dowsing and psychic police work<br>-- Science: chronicles and evaluates formal research into psychic capacities, especially ESP; hypnosis; psychic performers such as Pavel Stepanek, Bill Delmore, and Uri Geller; psychokinesis</p><p>Throughout the book, Mishlove presents the viewpoints of both believers and nonbelievers as a further means of introducing the language and concepts of psychic functioning.</p>This revised edition is more of a history than an encyclopedic study, although it is a thorough review of the literature of the occult and the paranormal, mystical, and religious roots of what can broadly be termed "consciousness." The study is filled with useful information, although it tends to accept the information without evaluating how it fits into the fabric of science, when often the data directly conflict with the rest of science. One wonders, for example, why the magician James Randi's exposure and duplication of psychic surgery is not mentioned (although his work on faith healing is). Most of the healings described have little or no scientific evidence to back them up. They may be useful in suggesting future research, but by themselves the data, and this book, must be used with caution.<br><i>- Gordon Stein, Univ. of Rhode Island, Kingston</i><br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Chevrolet Astro &amp; gmc Safari Mini Van '85'98</h2><p>Total Car Care is the most complete, step-by-step automotive repair manual you&#39;ll ever use.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

K. Scott Moncrieff) (Everyman&#39;s Library Classics)</h2><p>Millennium Project edition without library markings, shelf wear to dust jacket, page edges tanned. Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Officer, diplomat, spy, journalist, and intermittent genius, Marie Henri Beyle employed more than 200 aliases in the course of his crowded career. His most famous moniker, however, was Stendhal, which he affixed to his greatest work, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i>. The author spent a mere seven weeks cranking out this marvel in 1838, setting the fictional equivalent of a land-speed record. To be honest, there are occasional signs of haste, during which he clearly bypassed <i>le mot juste</i> in favor of narrative zing. So what? Stendhal at his sloppiest is still wittier, and wiser about human behavior, than just about any writer you could name. No wonder so meticulous a stylist as Paul Val�ry was happy to forgive his sins against French grammar: "We should never be finished with Stendhal. I can think of no greater praise than that."<p> The plot of <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> suggests a run-of-the-mill potboiler, complete with court intrigue, military derring-do, and more romance than you can shake a saber at. But Stendhal had an amazing, pre-Freudian grasp of psychology (at least the Gallic variant). More than most of his contemporaries, he understood the incessant jostling of love, sex, fear, and ambition, not to mention our endless capacity for self-deception. No wonder his hero, Fabrizio de Dongo, seems to know everything and nothing about himself. Even under fire at the Battle of Waterloo, the young Fabrizio has a tendency to lose himself in Napoleonic reverie: </p><blockquote>Suddenly everyone galloped off. A few moments later Fabrizio saw, twenty paces ahead, a ploughed field that seemed to be strangely in motion; the furrows were filled with water, and the wet ground that formed their crests was exploding into tiny black fragments flung three or four feet into the air. Fabrizio noticed this odd effect as he passed; then his mind returned to daydreams of the Marshal's glory. He heard a sharp cry beside him: two hussars had fallen, riddled by bullets; and when he turned to look at them, they were already twenty paces behind the escort.</blockquote> The quote above, a famous one, captures something of Stendhal's headlong style. Until now, most English-speaking readers have experienced it via C.K. Scott-Moncrieff's superb 1925 translation. But now Richard Howard has modernized his predecessor's period touches, streamlined some of the fussier locutions, and generally given Stendhal his high-velocity due. The result is a timely version of a timeless masterpiece, which shouldn't need to be updated again until, oh, 2050. Crammed with life, lust, and verbal fireworks, <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> demonstrates the real truth of its creator's self-composed epitaph: "He lived. He wrote. He loved." <i>--James Marcus</i>Richard Howard's exuberant and definitive rendition of Stendhal's stirring tale has brought about the rediscovery of this classic by modern readers. Stendhal narrates a young aristocrat's adventures in Napoleon's army and in the court of Parma, illuminating in the process the whole cloth of European history. As Balzac wrote, "Never before have the hearts of princes, ministers, courtiers, and women been depicted like this...one sees perfection in every detail." <br>With beautiful illustrations by Robert Andrew Parker.</p><h2>Confessions of an English Opium-Eater: and Other Writings (Oxford World&#39;s Classics)</h2><p>This selection of De Quincey's writings includes the title piece--his most famous work--as well as "On the Knocking at the Gate in <em>Macbeth</em>," "The English Mail-Coach," and the <em>Suspiria de Profundis</em>.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Dickens's tale takes us from the foggy dank streets of London and the maze of the Inns of Court to the peaceful countryside of England. Likewise, the characters run from murderous villains to virtuous girls, from a devoted lover to a "fallen woman," all of whom are affected by a legal suit in which there will, of course, be no winner. The first-person narrative related by the orphan Esther is particularly sweet. The articulate reading by the acclaimed British actor Paul Scofield, whose distinctive broad English accent lends just the right degree of sonority and humor to the text, brings out the color in this classic social commentary disguised as a Victorian drama. However, to abridge Dickens is, well, a Dickensian task, the results of which make for a story in which the author's convoluted plot lines and twists of fate play out in what seems to be a fast-forward format. Listeners must pay close attention in order to keep up with the multiple narratives and cast of curious characters, including the memorable Inspector Bucket and Mr. Guppy. Fortunately, the publisher provides a partial list of characters on the inside jacket. (<i>Running time: 3 hours; 2 cassettes</i>)Founded in 1906 by J.M.

From 1501 to 1505, Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo Buonarroti both lived and worked in Florence. Leonardo was a charming, handsome fifty year-old at the peak of his career. Michelangelo was a temperamental sculptor in his mid-twenties, desperate to make a name for himself.<br><br>Michelangelo is a virtual unknown when he returns to Florence and wins the commission to carve what will become one of the most famous sculptures of all time: David. Even though his impoverished family shuns him for being an artist, he is desperate to support them. Living at the foot of his misshapen block of marble, Michelangelo struggles until the stone finally begins to speak. Working against an impossible deadline, he begins his feverish carving.<br><br>Meanwhile, Leonardo's life is falling apart: he loses the hoped-for David commission; he can't seem to finish any project; he is obsessed with his ungainly flying machine; he almost dies in war; his engineering designs disastrously fail; and he is haunted by a woman he has seen in the market--a merchant's wife, whom he is finally commissioned to paint. Her name is Lisa, and she becomes his muse.<br><br>Leonardo despises Michelangelo for his youth and lack of sophistication. Michelangelo both loathes and worships Leonardo's genius.<br><br><i>Oil and Marble</i> is the story of their nearly forgotten rivalry. <br><br>Skyhorse Publishing, as well as our Arcade, Yucca, and Good Books imprints, are proud to publish a broad range of books for readers interested in fiction--novels, novellas, political and medical thrillers, comedy, satire, historical fiction, romance, erotic and love stories, mystery, classic literature, folklore and mythology, literary classics including Shakespeare, Dumas, Wilde, Cather, and much more.

A rewarding read for art aficionados and fans of historical fiction."-- <i>Booklist</i><br><br>"Vividly evoking the turbulent world and ferociously competitive spirit of Renaissance Florence, Stephanie Storey transports the reader to one of the most creative and exciting moments in the history of that remarkable city."--William E.

Leonardo's love for the muse Lisa and Michelangelo's loving obsession to create something of great beauty from a block of imperfect stone. Stephanie Storey perfectly describes this artistic love as she paints her own masterpiece in the character of Leonardo." -- Thomas Crowe, <i>Smoky Mountain News</i><br><br>"<i>Oil and Marble</i> is a magnificent story brimming with an all-star cast of world famous artists conducted by the talent of author Stephanie Storey... An intriguing unforgettable classic piece of historical fiction." -- Hudson Booksellers, Best of 2016<br><br>"Before I got to the bottom of the first page, I was completely engrossed in <i>Oil and Marble</i>.

Following the conquest of&nbsp;&nbsp;Babylon by the Persian Empire, the Israelites sought&nbsp;&nbsp;to re-establish their ethnic and religious legacy&nbsp;&nbsp;in Judah. This was a time of profound turmoil and&nbsp;&nbsp;uncertainty, and Haggai and Zechariah provided a&nbsp;&nbsp;crucial measure of support and inspiration. They&nbsp;&nbsp;rallied Israel's energies and exhorted their fellow&nbsp;&nbsp;countrymen to heed the word of God. Under their&nbsp;&nbsp;guidance the Jews restored the Temple at Jerusalem&nbsp;&nbsp;which had been destroyed by the armies of&nbsp;&nbsp;Nebuchadnezzar.

O. Matthiessen (Oxford Books of Verse)</h2><p>A worthy companion to <em>The Oxford Book of English Verse</em>, this anthology covers, in 571 selections, the whole range of American poetry from colonial times; more than half of it is devoted to the best work of the period from 1900 to 1950. Fifty-one poets represented--deliberately fewer than in most anthologies, so that sufficient space can be devoted to each poet to afford a real understanding of his or her work. More recent and less well-known poets are represented wherever possible by works of some length rather than by a scattering of short poems. Brief biographical notes at the end enable the reader to know in what volume of the poet's work each poem originally appeared.</p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br><strong>F. O. Matthiessen</strong> was a Californian by birth but grew up in Illinois, Pennsylvania, and New York. Educated both here and abroad, he started teaching in 1927, first at Yale and then at Harvard, where he was Professor of History and Literature. He made the field of American poetry one of his major interests and wrote critical estimates of Emerson, Poe, Eliot, and other contemporary poets.

What remains is a sometimes uneven but always stirring record one of the most fascinating and controversial figures of the Twentieth Century. <p> Carmichael was born in Trinidad, but his life as an activist began with his immersion in the Civil Rights movement at the Bronx High School of Science and then Howard University in the 1950s and 60s. At Howard he joined the Nonviolent Action Group (NAG) and later, the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), through which he drove voter registration efforts in Mississippi and Alabama. Later, as chairman of the SNCC he moved beyond the teachings of nonviolent resistance and forged the Black Power movement, authoring one of its key documents, "Toward Black Liberation" with Thelwell. He became a nationally recognized figure, reviled by leaders on both the left and the right for his apparent abandonment of integration. Yet his vision for black self-determinism would empower a generation of African-American artists, scholars, and leaders to embrace a new vision of African and African-American identity that is still transforming black culture. Eventually, Carmichael settled in Guinea, where he became a member of the ruling party and spent his later years promulgating his vision for Pan-African revolution. </p><p> In the introduction to <i>Ready for Revolution</i>, Thelwell admits that, in keeping the story faithful to the recordings, he left it essentially a "first draft" of Carmichael's vision. Thelwell's intrusions in the text, whether his own points or thoughts of others whom he interviewed are bracketed--while this formal approach honors Carmichael's words, the passages are often distracting and would have been better left as endnotes. Further, Thelwell seems to let Carmichael's original text stand where some pruning would have been beneficial, notably in Carmichael's overly detailed recounting of his school days. That said, Thelwell has done a great service to African-American studies by shepherding Carmichael's controversial, quirky, and uncompromising autobiography into print. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p><b>Stokely Carmichael</b> died in Guinea in 1998. Head of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee, he was also honorary prime minister of the Black Panther Party and a bestselling author. <b>Ekwueme Michael Thelwell,</b> professor of Afro-American Studies at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, is the author of the classic novel <i>The Harder They Come</i> and numerous influential articles on politics and literature.</p><h2>Just the Facts, Ma&#39;Am: The Authorized Biography of Jack Webb</h2><p>On television he was just a cop doing his job. But Jack Webb, in his low-key tough-guy approach in portraying Los Angeles police sergeant, Joe Friday, became an American cult hero. Today, Dragnet continues to appear on cable and syndicated television as a result of Jack Webb&#x2019;s single-minded determination and his unflagging attention to detail. His non-stop work ethic produced some of television&#x2019;s greatest moments, but it also took a devastating toll on his personal and professional relationships. <p>This authorized biography recalls how Webb grew up in poverty but was able to use his creative talents to find success in high school and in the Army Air Corps. After being discharged, Webb found a position as a local radio announcer in San Francisco and was recruited to do the voice of a hard-boiled San Francisco detective for a weekly program. The popularity of Pat Novak for Hire led to other radio jobs in the forties, culminating in Jack&#x2019;s creation of Dragnet. The success of Dragnet came from its accurate depiction of the life of a regular policeman, with stories based on files found in the Los Angeles Police Department archives. </p><p>When television&#x2019;s popularity increased Webb successfully transitioned the Dragnet series to the small screen and experienced unprecedented popularity. Webb would go on to produce great television classics such as Adam-12 and Emergency. When he passed away in 1982, he had left behind a television legacy of gritty realism that lives on today.</p></p><p>His portrayal of Joe Friday on Dragnet and his creation of Adam-12 and Emergency make Jack Webb of one entertainment&#39;s greatest icons. The authors reveal the private side of Jack Webb, a mixture of creativity, hard work, and mercurial temperament. With the help of Webb&#39;s daughter, Stacy, Moyer and Alvarez give Dragnet fans an honest portrayal of a driven and complicated man.Dan Moyer spent years working with Webb&#x2019;s daughter, Stacy in researching her father&#x2019;s life and career.

The authors use calculus and algebra to make general relativity accessible, and use quotes from well-known personalities, including Einstein, to offer further insight. <b> </b> Five chapters introduce basic theory. The book also includes seven projects regarding the analysis of major applications. Discussions provide the background needed to carry out projects. The book's projects guide readers as they fill in steps, compute outcomes and carry out their own investigations. <b> </b> For astronomers, mathematicians and people interested in learning about the relativity of black holes. </p></p><p><p> <i>Exploring Black Holes: An Introduction to General Relativity</i> was written by Oersted Medal winner <b>Edwin Taylor</b> and foremost relativist <b>John Archibald Wheeler</b>.</p><p>American Journal of Physics, Vol. 69, No. 11, pp. 1212-1213, November 2001<br> <br>(c)2001 American Association of Physics Teachers. All rights reserved.</p> <br> <br> <p>Most students embarking on a major in physics probably anticipate that they will have the opportunity to elect one or more semesters of study in relativity, and many students majoring in mathematics and computer science also have a strong interest in the subject. Among the introductory texts on special relativity, Taylor and Wheeler's Spacetime Physics (SP), with its conversational tone and its emphasis on geometry, has long played an important role. However, there have been few if any books on general relativity that have managed to be both scholarly and truly introductory. <b>Exploring Black Holes: Introduction to General Relativity (EBH)</b> is just such a book. Through carefully chosen restrictions on coverage, the authors enable the serious study of general relativity by students who have completed a year of calculus and who are prepared for intellectual labor.</p> <br> <br> <p>The book has been years in the making; there were several self-published preliminary versions. Thomas Roman of Central Connecticut State University provided a post-use review of the 1995 version (Scouting Black Holes: Exploring General Relativity with Calculus) in this journal [63, 1053-1054 (1995)]. EBH retains the basic structure of that earlier version, but the authors have made many improvements, additions, and corrections. The process of refinement continues: I am informed that Edwin Taylor uses each new printing of the text to correct errors and polish explanations.</p> <br> <br> <p>I used <b>EBH</b> in a course entitled "Topics in Physics: Relativity" at James Madison University during the Fall 2000 semester; the prerequisites were one year each of physics and calculus. Fourteen students enrolled for the course, and twelve completed it (six seniors, three juniors, and three sophomores). All had encountered special relativity in the introductory physics survey, and the upper-division physics majors had also spent a couple of weeks studying special relativity in a one-semester modern physics course.</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>EBH</b> was one of three required texts, the other two being SP and Kip Thorne's <b>Black Holes and Time Warps</b> (a narrative of the development of general relativity as witnessed by one of its foremost practitioners). Approximately half of the semester was devoted to a thorough discussion of special relativity using SP. The first few chapters of Thorne's book were<br>also assigned in the first half of the semester, both to lighten the reading load during the second half and to accustom students to Einstein's geometrical vision of gravitation.</p> <br> <br> <p>During the eight weeks devoted to general relativity, the class managed to cover all five chapters of <b>EBH</b> (Speeding, Curving, Plunging, Orbiting, and Seeing) and four of the seven "projects." Students found the project on the Global Positioning System (GPS) fascinating, both because several of them had used GPS devices and because general-relativistic effects must be included in the analysis in order to for the GPS system to be accurate enough to be useful.</p> <br> <br> <p>Almost without exception, the students rated <b>EBH</b> as very clear and interestingly written. Their previous contact with GR (if any) was of the "gee-whiz" variety, and they took evident pride in being able to grapple with some of the intellectual challenges of the theory. The authors are careful to acknowledge the limitations of a treatment in which the mathematical apparatus is limited to a year of calculus, but the students and I were pleased at how much can be accomplished. Our experience suggests that any physics professor who is prepared to make the effort can provide a worthy undergraduate introduction to GR, with the help of Taylor and Wheeler. My only prior experience with general relativity was a two-semester sequence (based on Weinberg's <b>Gravitation and Cosmology</b>) taken as a graduate student many years ago.</p> <br> <br> <p>The black and white text is replete with sample problems, well-drawn and amply captioned figures, and a good collection of end-of-chapter exercises. One idiosyncrasy that several students found annoying is that each chapter and project has its pages independently numbered. Because the chapters are identified by numbers and the projects are identified by capital letters, it is not always clear which way to turn when searching for a particular passage.</p> <br> <br> <p>Using <b>EBH</b> may also require an adjustment by those physics students and teachers who have come to expect that all physics texts should have a high ratio of equations to explanatory sentences. But the prose of this text is rich, sometimes whimsical, and always aimed directly at helping the reader develop an intuition for the physics that lives beneath the mathematical surface.</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>Spacetime Physics</b> is a jewel of an unconventional book on special relativity. With <b>Exploring Black Holes</b>, Taylor and Wheeler have presented the community of physics learners and teachers with another gem.</p> <br> <br> <p> <b>VITAE</b> </p> <br> <br> <p>William H.

Yet critics have argued about the precise nature of this novel or biography or "criticism-fiction" which is the summation of Sartre's philosophical, social, and literary thought. In the preface, Sartre writes: "<i>The Family Idiot</i> is the sequel to <i>Search for a Method.</i> The subject: what, at this point in time, can we know about a man? It seemed to me that this question could only be answered by studying a specific case." <br><br>Sartre discusses Flaubert's personal development, his relationship to his family, his decision to become a writer, and the psychosomatic crisis or "conversion" from his father's domination to the freedom of his art. Sartre blends psychoanalysis with a sociological study of the ideology of the period, the crisis in literature, and Flaubert's influence on the future of literature. <br><br>While Sartre never wrote the final volume he envisioned for this vast project, the existing volumes constitute in themselves a unified work&#x2014;one that John Sturrock, writing in the <i>Observer,</i> called "a shatteringly fertile, digressive and ruthless interpretation of these few cardinal years in Flaubert's life." <br><br>"A virtuoso perfomance. . . . For all that this book does to make one reconsider his life, <i>The Family Idiot</i> is less a case study of Flaubert than it is a final installment of Sartre's mythology. . . . The translator, Carol Cosman, has acquitted herself brilliantly."&#x2014;Frederick Brown, <i>New York Review of Books</i><br><br>"A splendid translation by Carol Cosman. . . . Sartre called <i>The Family Idiot</i> a 'true novel,' and it does tell a story and eventually reach a shattering climax. The work can be described most simply as a dialectic, which shifts between two seemingly alternative interpretations of Flaubert's destiny: a psychoanalytic one, centered on his family and on his childhood, and a Marxist one, whose guiding themes are the status of the artist in Flaubert's period and the historical and ideological contradictions faced by his social class, the bourgeoisie."&#x2014;Fredric Jameson, <i>New York Times Book Review</i><br><br>Jean-Paul Sartre (1906-1980) was offered, but declined, the Nobel Prize for literature in 1964.

In <i>Territory, Authority, Rights</i>, one of the world's leading authorities on globalization shows how the national state made today's global era possible. Saskia Sassen argues that even while globalization is best understood as "denationalization," it continues to be shaped, channeled, and enabled by institutions and networks originally developed with nations in mind, such as the rule of law and respect for private authority. This process of state making produced some of the capabilities enabling the global era. The difference is that these capabilities have become part of new organizing logics: actors other than nation-states deploy them for new purposes. Sassen builds her case by examining how three components of any society in any age--territory, authority, and rights--have changed in themselves and in their interrelationships across three major historical "assemblages": the medieval, the national, and the global.</p><br><p> The book consists of three parts. The first, "Assembling the National," traces the emergence of territoriality in the Middle Ages and considers monarchical divinity as a precursor to sovereign secular authority. The second part, "Disassembling the National," analyzes economic, legal, technological, and political conditions and projects that are shaping new organizing logics. The third part, "Assemblages of a Global Digital Age," examines particular intersections of the new digital technologies with territory, authority, and rights.</p><br><p> Sweeping in scope, rich in detail, and highly readable, <i>Territory, Authority, Rights</i> is a definitive new statement on globalization that will resonate throughout the social sciences.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Territory, Authority, Rights</i> takes up pivotal sources of friction in a process of globalization too often seen as simple and inexorable. With clarity and insight Sassen shows how the meaning of each is reconfigured in contemporary social change. Her work is essential to making sense of practical problems as well as theoretical issues."<b>--Craig Calhoun, Social Science Research Council</b></p><p>"Saskia Sassen is a spectacularly original thinker. She offers us not only new concepts, but often a new vocabulary. Her central insight in <i>Territory, Authority, Rights</i>, that understanding globalization actually requires focusing on the national-or more precisely, the phenomenon of 'denationalization' of many familiar domestic institutions and processes-opens the door to reimagining and retheorizing some of the most fundamental physical and political elements of our world."<b>--Anne-Marie Slaughter, Princeton University</b></p><p>"In this brilliant and pioneering work, Saskia Sassen provides a whole new way of thinking about globalization and political development generally. This is a stunning achievement. One of the beauties of the book is its careful historical analysis that puts the globalizing present in the contexts of the past. However, not only is the message important, but also the author's way of illustrating the story in wonderful detail, so we are reading specifics as well as sweeping abstract ideas."<b>--Yale H. Ferguson, Rutgers University, Newark</b></p><p>"<i>Territory, Authority, Rights</i> is a bold new work by the leading scholar of globalization. It will undoubtedly engage the author's many fans, renewing the conversation about globalization that Sassen has shaped in such substantial ways over the past twenty years. But far more than merely bringing her readers up to date with her thinking, the book also represents a major new theorization of globalization. Profoundly multidisciplinary, it will reach new audiences, and in the process redefine the issues, possibilities, and theoretical stakes in globalization. Sassen responds to globalization's critics from both right and left, carving out a distinctive analytical path with critical foundations of its own. The result is persuasive and compelling--a brilliant achievement that will define the research agenda with respect to globalization for years to come."<b>--Alfred Aman, Indiana University School of Law</b></p><b>Saskia Sassen</b> is professor of sociology and a member of the Committee on Global Thought at Columbia University, and Centennial Visiting Professor at the London School of Economics and Political Science.

Griet, the young daughter of a tilemaker in seventeeth century Holland, obtains her first job, as a servant in Vermeer&#39;s household. Tracy Chevalier shows us, through Griet&#39;s eyes, the complicated family, the society of the small town of Delft, and life with an obsessive genius. Griet loves being drawn into his artistic life, and leaving her former drudgery, but the cost to her own survival may be high.</p><p>With precisely 35 canvases to his credit, the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer represents one of the great enigmas of 17th-century art. The meager facts of his biography have been gleaned from a handful of legal documents. Yet Vermeer's extraordinary paintings of domestic life, with their subtle play of light and texture, have come to define the Dutch golden age. His portrait of the anonymous <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> has exerted a particular fascination for centuries--and it is this magnetic painting that lies at the heart of Tracy Chevalier's second novel of the same title.<p> <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> centers on Vermeer's prosperous Delft household during the 1660s. When Griet, the novel's quietly perceptive heroine, is hired as a servant, turmoil follows. First, the 16-year-old narrator becomes increasingly intimate with her master. Then Vermeer employs her as his assistant--and ultimately has Griet sit for him as a model. Chevalier vividly evokes the complex domestic tensions of the household, ruled over by the painter's jealous, eternally pregnant wife and his taciturn mother-in-law. At times the relationship between servant and master seems a little anachronistic. Still, <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> does contain a final delicious twist.</p><p> Throughout, Chevalier cultivates a limpid, painstakingly observed style, whose exactitude is an effective homage to the painter himself. Even Griet's most humdrum duties take on a high if unobtrusive gloss: </p><blockquote> I came to love grinding the things he brought from the apothecary--bones, white lead, madder, massicot--to see how bright and pure I could get the colors. I learned that the finer the materials were ground, the deeper the color. From rough, dull grains madder became a fine bright red powder and, mixed with linseed oil, a sparkling paint. Making it and the other colors was magical. </blockquote> In assembling such quotidian particulars, the author acknowledges her debt to Simon Schama's classic study <i>The Embarrassment of Riches</i>. Her novel also joins a crop of recent, painterly fictions, including Deborah Moggach's <i>Tulip Fever</i> and Susan Vreeland's <i>Girl in Hyacinth Blue</i>. Can novelists extract much more from the Dutch golden age? The question is an open one--but in the meantime, <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> remains a fascinating piece of speculative historical fiction, and an appealingly new take on an old master. <i>--Jerry Brotton</i>Q&gt;Everyday life in 17th-century Delft is so vivid in Girl with a Pearl Earring. How did you conduct your research? Where? <br><br>A&gt;Most of it, I confess, was done in my armchair. I read a lot (especially Simon Schama's The Embarrassment Of Riches: An Interpretation of Dutch Culture in The Golden Age) and looked at a lot of paintings. Luckily 17th-century Dutch paintings are mainly scenes from everyday life and so it was easy to see what houses looked like inside and how they were run. I also went to Delft for four days and just wandered around, taking it in. Vermeer's house no longer exists, but there are plenty of 17th-century buildings still left, as well as the Market Square, the Meat Hall, the canals and bridges. It's not hard to get an idea of what it was like then.<br><br>Q&gt;Little is known of Vermeer's life-at least compared with other Baroque painters like Rembrandt. Why did you choose Vermeer's work to write about? <br><br>A&gt;I chose Vermeer's work because it is so beautiful and so mysterious. In his paintings, the solitary women going about their domestic tasks-pouring milk, reading letters, weighing gold, putting on a necklace-inhabit a world that we are getting a secret glimpse at. And because it feels secret-the women don't seem to know we're looking at them-it seems also that something else is going on underneath, something mysterious we can't quite grasp. The fact that so little is known about Vermeer was happenstance-happily so, as it turned out, for it meant I could make up a lot without worrying about things being "true" or not. <br><br>Q&gt;Were you inspired by this particular painting or by Vermeer's work in general? A&gt;I was inspired specifically by this particular painting, though I know his other work as well. A poster of this painting has hung on the wall of my bedroom since I was nineteen and I often lie in bed and look at it and wonder about it. It's such an open painting. I'm never sure what the girl is thinking or what her expression is. Sometimes she seems sad, other times seductive. So, one morning a couple years ago I was lying in bed worrying about what I was going to write next, and I looked up at the painting and wondered what Vermeer did or said to the model to get her to look like that. And right then I made up the story.<br><br>Q&gt;Is <i>Girl with a Pearl Earring</i> a true story? To what extent is it based in fact? <br><br>A&gt;It isn't a true story. No one knows who the girl is, or in fact who any of the people in his paintings are. Very little is known about Vermeer-he left no writings, not even any drawings, just 35 paintings. The few known facts are based on legal documents-his baptism, his marriage, the births of his children, his will. I was careful to be true to the known facts; for instance, he married Catharina Bolnes and they had eleven surviving children. Other facts are not so clear-cut and I had to make choices: he may or may not have lived in the house of his mother-in-law (I decided he did); he converted to Catholicism at the time of his marriage but not necessarily because Catharina was Catholic (I decided he did); he may have been friends with the scientist Antony van Leeuwenhoek, who invented the microscope (I decided he was). But there was a lot I simply made up.<br><br>Q&gt; You chose to give your novel the same title as the painting. Is there a greater purpose for this? What sort of a relationship do you see the novel and the painting having? <br><br>A&gt;The novel has the same name as the painting because the painting is the culmination of the story; its creation is what the story is leading up to. It also points up the earring, which is important as a symbol because it represents the world Griet gets drawn into and ultimately rejected from. The novel could not exist without the painting. I would never have written it, and I don't think it would have the same resonance with readers if the painting didn't exist.<br><br>Q&gt;Do you paint? If not, how did you learn about the process and tools? <br><br>A&gt;I don't paint, though I did take a painting class while writing this book so I could find out a little about how it's done. I was absolutely awful at it, but I learned a lot. I also read about Vermeer's painting technique, and spoke with the woman who restored the painting for the 1996 Vermeer exhibition. She was able to explain to me some of the finer details of how he painted. <br><br>As for the paints and how they were made, I found some old books about making paints and learned from them. I also bought some linseed oil (which is mixed with pigment to make paint) and left the bottle open as I was writing so that I could smell what they would have smelled.<br><br>Q&gt; 17th-century literature reflected religious and social changes just like 17th-century painting. Milton's radical Paradise Lost was published during this time. Did you consider this sort of thing when writing an historical novel? <br><br>A&gt; I didn't consider Paradise Lost, but clearly religious change in the Netherlands at the time was a very important issue. The Dutch had just thrown off the rule of the Catholic Spanish and were keen to distance themselves from Catholicism. Protestantism suited their natures. The Dutch Catholics were tolerated but were seen as slightly outside the system, which is fascinating when you consider that Vermeer actually converted to Catholicism, and so chose to be a maverick. You have to consider religious and social change when writing historical novels. They are essential to the push and pull of the story. In fact, all my novels are historical and set during periods of great social change. My first novel, The Virgin Blue (published in Britain), is set during the 16th-century Reformation in France, and the novel I'm working on now is set in England at the beginning of the 20th-century and up through World War I. <br><br>Q&gt;While reading the novel, I couldn't help examining and re-examining the painting every few pages. Did you write the novel with the painting at hand? <br><br>A&gt;Oh yes. With all his paintings, in fact. I kept the catalogue from the 1996 Vermeer exhibition almost permanently open. Most of the characters' looks are based on people in his other paintings.I had the whole story worked out (except for the odd detail) before I started writing. This is unusual for me. Often I know only some of the story before I start writing. This book was a dream to write because of that and because the style is so spare. <br><br>Q&gt;Why the camera obscura? It plays such an important part, lending all sorts of ideas about technology and foreshadowing what's to come.<br><br>A&gt;The camera obscura is a tangible representation of a different way of looking. Griet has the capacity to look in a different way, but she needs Vermeer to show her how. He does that partly with the help of the camera obscura. It also reminds us that in order to see clearly you have to focus, shut out the world and look at one corner of a room. That is what Vermeer's paintings do-they reveal the world in a room. That is also what the novel tries to do-it is deliberately narrow and focused, and in it is a whole world.<br><br>Q&gt;What's next? Are you ready to work on another historical novel? <br><br>A&gt;Yes. The next novel is set in a Victorian cemetery in London at the turn of the century and up through World War I. It's about two girls whose families have adjacent plots at the cemetery, and the apprentice gravedigger they meet there. In a wider sense the book is about the changing values at the beginning of the modern era, looked at through the changing attitudes to death and mourning. The Victorians bought elaborate tombs for their dead and followed strict and elaborate mourning rituals, but by the end of World War I graves became much simpler and mourning was conducted in private. Why did this change occur? The book attempts to answer that. I can't seem to write a contemporary novel. I suppose I'm more comfortable in the past, where I know what is important and lasting. If I write about today, I worry that it will date in ten years' time.</p><h2>300 Years of Farm Implements and Machinery 1630-1930</h2><p>Chronicles more than three hundred years of antique farm machinery, tools, and implements, created between 1630 and 1930, tracing the history of American farm equipment from the early colonial period to the early twentieth century and providing helpful tips on identification, hundreds of photographs, original catalog advertisements, and more.

Straddling the movements of minimalism and land art, Smithson, who died in a plane crash at the age of 35, had a profound impact on the cultural landscape that resonates to this day. <i>Robert Smithson </i>presents essays by top Smithson scholars alongside both archival imagery and specially commissioned photography of the artist's works; it considers the interrelationship of Smithson's complete artistic output, from the earliest figurative work up to his famed earthworks. Smithson's revolutionary ideas positioned art as existing beyond the walls of the museum in media such as writing and film, and even in the landscape itself. This volume and the exhibition it accompanies explore Smithson's work within the context of the artistic climate of the late 1960s as well as ensuing decades. <br><br>Perhaps most renowned as the creator of <i>Spiral Jetty </i>(1970), a fifteen-hundred-foot rock coil dramatically situated in the Great Salt Lake, Smithson also broke new ground with his films, photographs, writing, drawings, and collages. Eugenie Tsai provides a curatorial overview of the exhibition, which includes early writings, drawings, and other work with religious, erotic, and pop culture motifs that deepen our understanding of Smithson's diverse practice. Other contributions to the volume are a previously unpublished interview with Smithson by Moira Roth; a substantive historical and critical essay by Thomas Crow; an essay by MOCA curator Cornelia Butler discussing Smithson's lineage and his influence on contemporary artists; and a series of texts focusing on key works from Smithson's oeuvre, including <i>Incidents of Mirror Travel in the Yucatan </i>by Suzaan Boettger, <i>Enantiomorphic Chambers </i>by Ann Reynolds, <i>Airport Terminal Project </i>by Mark Linder, <i>Spiral Jetty </i>by Jennifer Roberts, <i>Heap of Language </i>by Richard Sieburth, <i>Proposal for Monument at Antartica </i>[sic] by Robert Sobieszek. The book also features the complete <i>Library List&#x2015;</i>a posthumously compiled list of publications in Smithson's personal library&#x2015;with an introduction by Alexander Alberro, as well as an exhibition checklist and annotated exhibition chronology. <br><br>With contributions by Alexander Alberro, Suzaan Boettger, Cornelia Butler, Thomas Crow, Mark Linder, Ann Reynolds, Jennifer L.

From his earliest comics, including the celebrated <em>Spirit</em>, to his pioneering graphic novels, Eisner understood that the proper use of anatomy is crucial to effective storytelling. His control over the mechanical and intuitive skills necessary for its application set him apart among comics artists, and his principles of body grammar have proven invaluable to legions of students in overcoming what is perhaps the most challenging aspect of creating comics. Buttressed by dozens of illustrations, which display Eisner&#x2019;s mastery of expression, both subtle and overt, <em>Expressive Anatomy for Comics and Narrative</em> will benefit comics fans, students, and teachers and is destined to become the essential primer on the craft.</p><p>Born in New York City, Will Eisner (1917&#x2013;2005) was the author of the legendary comic strip The Spirit, as well as fifteen graphic novels and three influential instructional textbooks. The comic industry&#x2019;s top awards, the Eisner Awards, are named in his honor.</p><h2>Fascia in Sport and Movement</h2><p>The book covers most current research and theory to underpin practice.

Western scholars and interpreters of the dakini, influenced by Jungian psychology and feminist goddess theology, have shaped a contemporary critique of Tibetan Buddhism in which the dakini is seen as a psychological "shadow," a feminine savior, or an objectified product of patriarchal fantasy. According to Judith Simmer-Brown&#x2014;who writes from the point of view of an experienced practitioner of Tibetan Buddhism&#x2014;such interpretations are inadequate. In the spiritual journey of the meditator, Simmer-Brown demonstrates, the dakini symbolizes levels of personal realization: the sacredness of the body, both female and male; the profound meeting point of body and mind in meditation; the visionary realm of ritual practice; and the empty, spacious qualities of mind itself. When the meditator encounters the dakini, living spiritual experience is activated in a nonconceptual manner by her direct gaze, her radiant body, and her compassionate revelation of reality. Grounded in the author's personal encounter with the dakini, this unique study will appeal to both make and female spiritual seekers interested in goddess worship, women's spirituality, and the tantric tradition.</p><p>Judith Simmer-Brown, Ph.D., is professor and chair of the religious studies department at Naropa University (formerly the Naropa Institute), where she has taught since 1978. She has authored numerous articles on Tibetan Buddhism, Buddhist-Christian dialogue, and Buddhism in America. She is an Acharya (senior teacher) in the lineage of Ch�gyam Trungpa. A practicing Buddhist since 1971, she lives in Boulder, Colorado.Simmer-Brown (chair, religious studies, Naropa Univ.) has produced a comprehensive, scholarly, and intriguing study of "dakini," the feminine principle in Tibetan Buddhism. She defines dakini as a symbol "who personifies in Tibetan Buddhism the spiritual process of surrendering expectation and concept, revealing limitless space and pristine awareness." The methodology she employs in her study includes both scholarly preparation and training in Vajrayana Buddhist practice traditions. She is sensitive to and articulate about feminist issues related to her subject and on this basis finds the prevailing modes of feminist and Jungian paradigms lacking in there assessment of dakini. Therefore, she proposes more appropriate methodologies that draw on the disciplines of history of religions and gender studies. As she reviews the Indian historical background of dakini, she is careful to differentiate dakini in Tibetan tantric literature from dakini's "Hindu tantric cousins." While Thinley Norbu's Magic Dance: The Display of the Self-Nature of the Five Wisdom Dakinis is more poetic, Simmer-Brown's work is more scholarly and focused. It also includes an examination of the hagiographic lore about dakini and ends with a description of dakini as the protector of tantric teachings and midwife of the transmission of teachings. Recommended as a landmark study which will be a useful addition to any library's holdings on Tibetan Buddhism.

For this riveting book, he returns to the South Bronx with a sociological eye and provides an unprecedented insider&#x2019;s look at the workings of a group of Dominican drug robbers. Known on the streets as &#x201c;Stickup Kids,&#x201d; these men raided and brutally tortured drug dealers storing large amounts of heroin, cocaine, marijuana, and cash.<br><br>As a participant observer, Randol Contreras offers both a personal and theoretical account for the rise of the Stickup Kids and their violence.

Using a multi-disciplinary approach--including analysis of rhetorical style and concept of identity and community--Stout examines more than two thousand sermons spanning five generations of ministers, including such giants of the pulpit as John Cotton, Thomas Shepard, Increase and Cotton Mather, George Whitefield, Jonathan Edwards, Jonathan Mayhew, and Charles Chauncy, as well a numerous lesser-known preachers. Stout reconstructs the full import of the colonial sermon as a multi-faceted institution that served both religious and political purposes, and explained history and society to the New England Puritans for one and a half centuries.</p><p>Stout has created a field of scholarship hitherto neglected---the manuscript sermon as a source of religious culture in colonial times. More than that, he has shown the extent to which sermon notes add to our knowledge of the times, notably for the period of the Great Awakening. And he has done so with great insight.Harry S. Stout is at Yale University.</p><h2>Daily Life in Medieval Times: A Vivid, Detailed Account of Birth, Marriage and Death; Food, Clothing and Housing; Love and Labor in the Middle Ages</h2><p>Daily Life in Medieval Times is a fully-illustrated edition of the classic and popular books of history and anthropology by Frances and Joseph Gies - Life in a Medieval Castle, Life in a Medieval City and Life in a Medieval Village.<p> This book takes readers into the fascinating world of medieval life through historic pictures, period illustrations and detailed text that describes everything from castle-storming techniques to villagers' hair styles.</p><p> Three real medieval places - a castle in Chepstow on the Welsh border, the city of Troyes in the country of Champagne and the village of Elton in the English East Midlands - are the jumping - off point for this thorough exploration of 13th and 14th century life in Europe.</p><p> The authors use recent archeloogical discoveries and historic and contemporary documents in conjunction with diagrams and dramatic photographs to give readers a full understanding of what it was truly like to live 700 years ago.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p></p><p>The Middle Ages have long been looked upon as the most exciting epoch in world history. DAILY LIFE IN MEDIEVAL TIMES, the most historically accurate depiction of the period ever written, transports you back in time to experience the life and mind of the 1400s firsthand. In this illustrated edition of Frances and Joseph Gies' classic book of history and anthropology--LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CASTLE, LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL CITY and LIFE IN A MEDIEVAL VILLAGE--the authors examine the most up-to-date information gleaned from recent archeological discoveries and historical artifacts to document the lives of evey member of medieval society: kings and clergy, knights and ladies, peasants and servants, all painstakingly researched and rendered in fascinating detail.<p> To get a true sense of how it was to live 700 years ago, DAILY LIFE IN MEDIEVAL TIMES displays all the elements of feudal life--its trials, travails, pleasures and pains. The lively narrative is rich with historical minutia detailing everything from hairstyles and high fashion, to entertainment and recreation, to batle techniques and medieval justice, alongside hundreds of maps, diagrams, vivid photographs and ancient illustrations. The book centers on three major areas: life in a castle, in a village and in a medieval city, and examines three specific sites--a castle in Chepstow on the Welsh border, the city of Troyes in the Champagne region and the village of Elton in the English East Midlands--as starting points for portraying life in all its variations. Every aspect of the 12th and 13th century world is addresed: holidays, harvests and the calendar of the Middle Ages; childbirth, disease and medieval medicine; moneylenders, the guilds and big business; fires, famines and the ever-present threat of disaster. We are shown how each individual contributed towards a working society and how that society functioned, prospered and eventually faded with the dawn of the Renaissance.</p><p> The breadth and depth of information the authors uncover allows us to see beyond the simple surface particulars of the day; DAILY LIFE IN MEDIEVAL TIMES weaves an elaborate social backdrop that evokes the values, mores, fears, and ambitions shared by all members of the medieval community. What emerges are a people who interact, who work and play and who live lives that mirror our own in fascinating and unexpected new ways. </p><p></p>Frances and Joseph Gies are the authors, together and separately, of 21 books, including <i>Women in the Middle Ages</i> and <i>The Knight in History</i>. They live near Ann Arbor, Michigan and have three grown children and three grandchildren.</p><h2>Against Doom: A Climate Insurgency Manual</h2><p>Late in 2015, nearly two hundred countries signed the Paris Agreement acknowledging their individual and collective duty to protect the earth&#x2019;s climate&#x2014;and willfully refused to perform that duty. In response to this institutional failure and to growing climate destruction, we are witnessing the birth of a global nonviolent constitutional insurgency.<i> Against Doom: A Climate Insurgency Manual </i>tells how to put strategy into action&#x2014;and how it can succeed. It is a handbook for halting global warming and restoring our climate&#x2014;a how-to for climate insurgents.</p><p><b>Jeremy Brecher</b> is the author of more than a dozen books on labor and social movements, including<i> Save the Humans? Common Preservation in Action</i> and his classic labor history<i> Strike!</i>. He has been writing about climate protection since 1988, most recently in his book<i> Climate Insurgency: A Strategy for Survival</i>. In addition to being awarded five regional Emmy Awards for his documentary film work, Jeremy was arrested in the early White House sit-ins against the Keystone XL pipeline."A crisp, clear, and savvy synthesis of key concepts and ideas that will help the global climate justice movement to succeed. Brecher outlines many feasible climate solutions that should give all of us hope, despite the odds." &#x2014;Naomi Klein, author,&nbsp;<i>This Changes Everything: Capitalism vs. the Climate</i><br><br>"<b>Against Doom</b> lays out key elements of a far-reaching, global-scaled, pragmatic, people-powered strategy to topple the power of the fossil fuel industry and the institutions behind it." &#x2014;David Solnit, author,&nbsp;<i>Globalize Liberation: How to Uproot the System and Build a Better World</i><br><br>"In <i>Against Doom</i>, Brecher has provided the climate movement with two essential tools: a moral framework for the struggle against fossil fuels, and an actual plan for victory. By blending sober social movement analysis with the fire of grassroots activism, this book shows that there is a genuine, and winnable, case against the fossil fuel economy&#x2014;a case to be argued in the streets as well as the courtroom. It's an essential volume for anyone committed to social change in the fight against climate change." &#x2014;Joseph Hamilton, Climate Defense Project<br><br>"If you have any interest in climate change but needed current data in your hands . . . then this easily qualifies." &#x2014;GF Willmetts, sfcrowsnest.org.uk<br><br>"In <i>Against Doom</i>, Brecher ties complex strategies for a just transition to a sustainable civilization that seeks broad cooperation from diverse organizations and groups. This book is a great read." &#x2014;nixbeat.com<br><br>"Climate insurgency is a strategy for using people power to realise our common interest in protecting the climate. It uses mass, global, nonviolent action to challenge the legitimacy of public and corporate officials who are perpetrating climate destruction." &#x2014;Ian Angus, <i>Green Left Weekly</i><br><br>"Neither glitzy, eloquent nor subtle, Brecher methodically lays out an interlocking vision of direct action within a constitutional legal framework to build the powerful nonviolent climate insurgency necessary to turn the ship around." &#x2014;Jay O'Hara, wagingnonviolence.org<br><br>"<i>Against Doom</i> is a hopeful plan of action to prevent a catastrophic climate bust. Brecher explores various pathways to challenge big fossil fuels&#x2019; grip on politics and the economy. We are racing against the clock, so read <i>Against Doom</i> and take action now." &#x2014;Bennett Baumer, indypendent.org<br><br>"Jeremy Brecher has managed to combine his passion for justice with the wisdom gleaned from decades of research, writing, and personal engagement in social movements and condense them into this short and accessible strategy document. Having benefited from his guidance on a variety of campaigns over the last twenty years, I look forward to collaborating with other organizers and activists in using this book as a blueprint for building a global climate insurgency." &#x2014;John Humphries, Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs<br><br>"Brecher explains in clear ways just how civil resistance could be developed further and made a core strategy of an effective climate justice movement . . . . Right now, I just want to urge people to read this book!" &#x2014;Steve Chase, nonviolent-conflict.org</p><h2>Hopper Drawing</h2><p>Edward Hopper (1882 1967) is recognized as one of the most well-known American artists of the 20th century. His distinctive style, combining subtle observations of the world with his imagination, has not only influenced other artists but also photographers, filmmakers, and popular culture. Although Hopper is primarily known for his oil paintings, including such iconic works as <i>Nighthawks </i>(1942) and <i>Early Sunday Morning</i> (1930), this important publication is the first comprehensive exploration of his drawings and working methods. &nbsp; &nbsp; In 1967, Hopper&#x2019;s widow, Josephine Nivison Hopper, bequeathed her husband&#x2019;s artistic estate to the Whitney Museum of American Art, including a fascinating collection of more than 2,500 drawings spanning his entire career. This group of works has never been the subject of in-depth study and many have never been reproduced before. Hopper kept these drawings for personal reference as he revisited various themes throughout his career. Carter E. Foster examines how Hopper used his drawings to develop his paintings, arguing that the artist&#x2019;s work can only be fully understood after&nbsp;careful study of these preparatory sketches. Foster also argues that Hopper was, in many ways, a traditional draftsman who methodically developed schematic ideas into detailed studies to refine content. However, the steps toward this refinement are unique to Hopper and reveal how he turned the mundane into poetic images with universal appeal. &nbsp;</p><p><p>The first exploration of Edward Hopper&#x2019;s detailed compositional studies and figure drawings demonstrates how he transformed the mundane into poetic images with universal appeal.</p><p><b>Carter E.

This richly illustrated book reproduces in full color one hundred of Rothko&#39;s paintings, prints, and drawings. The volume features four commentaries by art experts who explore various formal aspects of Rothko&#39;s work, interviews with contemporary artists who reflect on Rothko&#39;s legacy to post-New York School abstraction, and a chronology of the Russian-born artist&#39;s life from 1903 to 1970.</p><p>Jeffrey Weiss is associate curator of twentieth-century art at the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C. He is the author of The Popular Culture of Modern Art: Picasso, Duchamp, and Avant-Gardism, 1909-1917, published by Yale University Press.Rothko's most famous paintings are profoundly contemplative works, rectangles of vibrant color that seem lit from within and that are full of subtle energy and life, like the sky or the surface of a lake. This handsome retrospective catalog of his work, which includes his early representational paintings as well as his harmonic abstractions, has been published in conjunction with a major traveling exhibition of his work and contains more than 100 colorplates. Weiss has wisely placed the art before the commentary, allowing readers to absorb the quiet impact of Rothko's work before seeking explanations of the man and his still controversial creations in essays by Weiss, John Cage, Barbara Novak and Brian O'Doherty, and Carol Mancusi-Ungaro. Interviews with painters Ellsworth Kelly, Gerhard Richter, and Robert Ryman attest to Rothko's tremendous influence, and a detailed chronology tracks his rise to prominence, his steadily deteriorating health, and his suicide in 1970. Weiss' book succeeds in embracing the beauty, mystery, and sorrow of Rothko's vision. <i>Donna Seaman</i></p><h2>Fundamentals of General, Organic, and Biological Chemistry</h2><p><p><b></b> Rewritten throughout for enhanced clarity and readability &#x2013; without sacrificing content &#x2013; this best-seller offers a focus on problem-solving and engaging discussions of relevant applications. <b></b> Effectively covers the essentials of allied health chemistry without excessive and unnecessary detail.

In one generation they moved from the fields to Silicon Valley. They accomplished this through three totally unexpected miracles: economic development, democratization, and the arrival of their culture to global attention.</p><p>Who are the Koreans? What are they like? <i>The New Koreans</i> examines how they have been perceived by outsiders, the features that color their &#x201c;national character,&#x201d; and how their emergence from backwardness, poverty, and brutality happened. It also looks at why they remain unhappy&#x2015;with the lowest birth rates and highest suicide rates in the developed world. </p><p>In <i>The New Koreans</i>, Michael Breen provides compelling insight into the history and character of this fascinating nation of South Korea, and casts an eye to future developments, as well as across the DMZ into North Korea.</p></p><p>MICHAEL BREEN is a writer and consultant who first went to Korea as a correspondent in 1982.

Thornton Wilder called it "a fantasia on certain events and persons of the last days of the Roman republic." Through vividly imagined letters and documents, Wilder brings to life a dramatic period of world history and one of history's most magnetic, elusive personalities.</p><p>In this inventive narrative, the Caesar of history becomes Caesar the human being. Wilder also resurrects the controversial figures surrounding Caesar -- Cleopatra, Catullus, Cicero, and others. All Rome comes crowding through these pages -- the Rome of villas and slums, beautiful women and brawling youths, spies and assassins.</p><p>Thornton Wilder (1897-1975) was an accomplished novelist and playwright whose works, exploring the connection between the commonplace and cosmic dimensions of human experience, continue to be read and produced around the world. His <em>Bridge of San Luis Rey</em>, one of seven novels, won the Pulitzer Prize in 1928, as did two of his four full-length dramas, <em>Our Town</em> (1938) and <em>The Skin of Our Teeth</em> (1943). Wilder's <em>The Matchmaker</em> was adapted as the musical <em>Hello, Dolly!</em>. He also enjoyed enormous success with many other forms of the written and spoken word, among them teaching, acting, the opera, and films. (His screenplay for Hitchcock's <em>Shadow of Doubt</em> [1943] remains a classic psycho-thriller to this day.) Wilder's many honors include the Gold Medal for Fiction from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the National Book Committee's Medal for Literature.</p></p><h2>don Miguel Ruiz&#39;s Little Book of Wisdom: The Essential Teachings (Toltec Wisdom Series)</h2><p><p>don Miguel Ruiz is the author of <i>The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love</i>, and numerous other best-selling books.

The author focuses on the development of the middle class in larger American cities, particularly Philadelphia and New York. He examines the middle class in all its complexity, and in its day-to-day existence--at work, in the home, and in the shops, markets, theaters, and other institutions of the big city. The book places the new language of class---in particular the new term &#34;middle class&#34;--in the context of the concrete, interwoven experiences of specific anonymous Americans who were neither manual workers nor members of urban upper classes.</p><p>Focusing on its development in larger American cities, particularly Philadelphia and New York, this study analyzes the day-to-day existence of the elusive middle class at work, at home and in the city."...[Blumin] approaches a wide range of questions, always ina stimulating manner, with a richness and density of illustration." M.J. Daunton, Journal of Urban History<br><br>"Stuart Blumin's book is the most important effort to date to bring the question of middle-class formation into the critical caldron of social change in early 19th-century America in the seaboard cities. The best of his evidence is from Philadelphia, whose social history he has mined with diligence and ingenuity. (There are appropriate comparisons with New York and Boston.)" Daniel T. Rodgers, The New Republic<br><br>"Blumin's book is a singular combination of massive synthesis, innovative methodology, and imaginative interpretation....Blumin's conceptualization of class is convincing and technically skillful in its implementation." David A. Gerber, Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography<br><br>"Historians have used the category ['middle class'] both to describe and explain social relations, but the criteria for class membership has remained vague.

More than anyone else, he shaped the culture of New England and his effort to create a Puritan "City on a Hill" has had a lasting effect on American values. <br> In <em>John Winthrop</em>, Francis J. Bremer draws on over a decade of research in England, Ireland, and the United States to offer a superb biography of Winthrop, one rooted in a detailed understanding of his first forty years in England. Indeed, Bremer provides an extensive, path-breaking treatment of Winthrop's family background, youthful development, and English career. His dissatisfaction with the decline of the "godly kingdom of the Stour Valley" in which he had been raised led him on his errand to rebuild such a society in a New England. In America, Winthrop would use the skills he had developed in England as he struggled with challenges from Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson, among others, and defended the colony from English interference. We also see the personal side of Winthrop--the doubts and concerns of the spiritual pilgrim, his everyday labors and pleasures, his feelings for family and friends. And Bremer also sheds much light on important historical moments in England and America, such as the Reformation and the rise of Puritanism, the rise of the middling class, the colonization movement, and colonial relations with Native Americans.<br> Incorporating previously unexplored archival materials from both sides of the Atlantic, here is the definitive portrait of one of the giants of our history.</p><p><br><strong>Francis J. Bremer</strong> is Editor of the Winthrop Papers for the Massachusetts Historical Society. A pioneer in the trans-Atlantic approach to early American history, he has been a visiting scholar at Oxford and Cambridge. He is Professor of History at Millersville University and lives in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.<br><br>"Bremer's diligently researched work is the definitive landmark study of its subject."-<em>Booklist</em><p></p><br>"An impressive, scholarly analysis of the life of John Winthrop."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"Bremer, editor of the Winthrop papers, draws on those papers to add tremendously to our understanding of this pivotal figure, eloquently reminding us in a rich, magisterial biography how much Winthrop contributed to the founding of the colonies.... Bremer's definitive biography gracefully portrays Winthrop as a man of his time, whose influence in the new colony grew out of his own struggles to establish his identity before he left England."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"A richly researched life of the Massachusetts Bay Colony's first governor, arguing that the Puritan leader was more moderate than history has conveyed.... One of Bremer's great achievements is to add flesh to the previous, skeletal portraits of Winthrop's life in England before he sailed West in 1630.... This scholarly makeover adds considerable color to Winthrop's wan cheeks."--<em>Kirkus Reviews</em><p></p><br>"Bremer's excellent and comprehensive biography restores Winthrop to his rightful place in American memory."--<em>Weekly Standard</em><p></p><br>"His deeply learned book is so rich in physical description and offers so many subtle and surprising intellectual insights that it should appeal even to readers whose eyes otherwise glaze over reading about 17th-century theology. You might say that the times are so well described that we are carried through the life.... He has marshaled his deep knowledge of the 17th century to give us a new, passionate, moderate and community-centered Winthrop."--<em>Minneapolis Star Tribune</em><p></p><br>"In his 1630 sermon 'A New Model of Christian Charity,' John Winthrop provided the defining and enduring metaphor of America as the 'City Set on A Hill.' Too long has the person behind the vision been lost to the obscurities of 17th century Puritanism. Frank Bremer has now restored him to his rightful place as the first founding father in the American pantheon."--Peter J. Gomes, Pusey Minister in The Memorial Church, Harvard University<p></p><br>"A wonderful achievement. The story of Winthrop's pilgrimage from unendurable stress in the Old World to endurable stress in the New World is captured with a freshness and vividness that kept me enthralled. The result is a convincing recreation of Winthrop's mental and physical worlds. This is one of the great early modern biographies."--John Morrill, University of Cambridge<p></p><br>"In this remarkable biography of John Winthrop, Bremer brings to life the English society that shaped John Winthrop's character and purpose and the colonial society that was in turn shaped by him. A major contribution to the field of puritan studies."--Carol Berkin, Baruch College and The Graduate Center, CUNY<p></p><br>"This is a splendid work, not afraid to take sides with its subject, but always judicious and sensitive to the context of a life spent in two continents. Bremer's study has wider implications than one man's career; he has thrown a flood of light on the beginnings of the Anglo-American world." --Diarmaid MacCulloch, Professor of the History of the Church, Oxford University.<p></p><br>"A brilliantly-researched example of what is now often termed the 'new' Atlantic History. Drawing upon archives in England and Massachusetts, he reconstructs the career of Governor John Winthrop, showing from a fresh and original perspective what it meant to be a Puritan."--T.H. Breen, Northwestern University<p></p><br></p><h2>Berlin Stories (Everyman&#39;s Library Pocket Classics Series)</h2><p><b>A gorgeously jacketed hardcover anthology of classic stories set in Berlin, by an international array of brilliant writers.</b><br><br>Spanning more than a century, this collection of stories reflects Berlin's rich and turbulent history, chronicling the creative ferment of the Weimar Republic, the devastation of wartime, the cruel divisions of the Berlin Wall, and the aftermath of reunification. Classics by Theodor Fontane and Robert Walser provide a window on privileged society at the turn of the century. Alfred D�blin, Erich Kastner, Vladimir Nabokov, and Christopher Isherwood illuminate the frenetic Golden Twenties and the ruinous crash that followed, while marginal youths roam the city's seamy underside in Irmgard Keun's <i>The Artificial Silk Girl</i> and Ernst Haffner's <i>Blood Brothers</i>. The hero of Thomas Wolfe's <i>You Can't Go Home Again</i> visits a city shadowed by Hitler's rise, while in Hans Fallada's <i>Alone in Berlin</i> a working-class couple quietly resists the Nazis. Cold War espionage enlivens works by Len Deighton and Ian McEwan; Christa Wolf's <i>They Divided the Sky </i>and Peter Schneider's <i>The Wall Jumper</i> depict the Berlin Wall's impact on a personal scale; and Thomas Brussig's Stasi officers engage in meaningless surveillance in Heroes Like Us. G�nter Grass shows us German reunification through the eyes of an elderly Luftwaffe veteran while Uwe Timm does so through a writer's madcap wanderings in a bewildering post-Wall landscape. Finally, more recent arrivals--from Chloe Aridjis's Mexican-Jewish university student in <i>Book of Clouds </i>to the desperate African refugees in Jenny Erpenbeck's <i>Go, Went, Gone</i>--bear witness to Berlin's continuing evolution as an arena of the possible.</p><p>Philip Hensher's novels include <i>The Northern Clemency,</i> which was short-listed for the Man Booker Prize; <i>Kitchen Venom,</i> which won the Somerset Maugham Award, and <i>The Mulberry Empire</i>, which was long-listed for the Man Booker Prize. Chosen by <i>Granta</i> as one of its Best Young British Novelists, he is professor of creative writing at Bath Spa University and a columnist for <i>The Guardian, The Spectator, </i>and<i> The Independent</i>. He lives in London.Foreword by Philip Hensher<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Compared to Paris, London or Rome, Berlin has a short history. There are no signs of habitation before the 12th century, and it remained a relatively insignificant place until the 18th century. At the end of the 17th century, Berlin&#x2019;s population was around 10,000, when Paris and London both had over half a million inhabitants. After that, the city grew explosively. It is substantially a creation of the nineteenth century, with all that era&#x2019;s addiction to modernity, technology and novelty. Its most celebrated contribution to urban architecture, the Wall, was only erected in the early 1960s. That was demolished thirty years ago in any case. It has always been a city of desperate modernity.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The physical substance is reflected in its characteristic ways of behaving and interacting. It has been a city dedicated to discovering new ways of living. In most decades of the twentieth century, Berlin has produced whole classes of people very conscious that they are living lives that nobody has ever attempted before. It is an arena of the possible, where the imagination carves out cities of the future. The first social housing projects are here. Gay men and lesbians started to live their lives openly in large numbers in the 1920s. The postwar division of the city and the Wall, too, created multiple possibilities, few foreseen, some explosive. In the aftermath of unification, the city was cheap and rundown; it quickly became a hub for creative artists. The sense of making it up as you go along is never far away in Berlin.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The fiction of Berlin exemplifies much of this excitement. Unlike most capital cities, it imposes no obligation on writers to come to terms with it. There are very many great German and German-language writers with absolutely nothing to say about Berlin. Those who do write about it, I suspect, are those who were drawn to it. Such writers may be of a particular type. Despite the different settings, and the totally different nature of each new experience described, a mood recurs. It is a mood of wonder and astonishment, lightly veiled in an affectation of chic boredom. We have seen all this before, suggests each writer, uncovering scenes that have never been dreamt of until this moment. A layer of period nostalgia has settled over Fontane, but in his time, he was an artist of the present moment, even of modernity. Erich Kastner&#x2019;s Fabian, behaving according to his most animal instincts and finding no resistance in those around him, is another example of this languid joy in the unprecedented. Another might be Irmgard Keun&#x2019;s heroine, making her way in the big city with what resources she has, or Ernst Haffner&#x2019;s gang of juvenile derelicts. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; These innovations don&#x2019;t always come from outcasts and drop-outs. Sometimes lives of unanticipated modernity are conducted in accordance with the central apparatuses of control and orthodoxy. Thomas Brussig&#x2019;s Stasi officers conduct their meaningless lives of surveillance like realist novelists determined to leave nothing out of the narrative. The Wall imposes its obligation to try to understand &#x2013; Peter Schneider&#x2019;s wall jumper and Uwe Timm&#x2019;s wanderer in a post-Wall landscape both seem like na�fs, so colossal and impregnable are the things they are trying to understand. Their behaviour is predicted and constrained by the Wall and its sudden absence. For Wladimir Kaminer or Kevin Barry, the newest arrivals in the city are literally making things up as they go along, finding out what the rules of engagement might be. For outsiders like Thomas Wolfe or Christopher Isherwood, it just doesn&#x2019;t seem possible to guess what might happen next; other outsiders, like Chloe Aridjis, place their trust in solitary wandering through the challenges of the city, old and new. Only at the moment of the shattering of the Wall, in Gunter Grass&#x2019;s prophetic and historic phantasmagoria, does it seem urgent to gaze backwards, to Fontane and beyond; his characters appear to be given a long vista by the sudden appearance of gaps in the long-standing barrier. Otherwise Berlin lives in the moment. When everything hangs on a thread, there is little appetite for nostalgia or reflection. In dread or excitement, the fiction looks forward.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I first went to Berlin in the 1980s, when the division between east and west seemed permanent, and the general mood was not exactly despairing, but resigned to the fact that nothing much mattered. You could do anything you liked. Nobody would care. I spent much more time there in the mid 1990s. The past made itself apparent &#x2013; the bullet holes on Wilhelmine facades, the remaining stretches of the Wall. Or just finding that the kitchen cupboard in the flat in Prenzlauer Berg I was borrowing was still half full of dried soups and dessert powders from the DDR. But in this city, you could not look back; you had to decide what you were going to do now, today, this minute. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a time of extraordinary possibilities and mad improvisations. People would open illegal bars in abandoned buildings or their own apartments. Some enterprises were undertaken according to anarchist principles. Entertainment could take surprising forms; an omni-sexual tango evening of alarming accomplishment in a Kreuzberg club, or a competition between half a dozen drag queens to determine who made the best goulash (the whole bar had a taste). Once I turned up at a regular bar of mine which occupied a boat on the canal, only to find that it had sunk the night before. Some friends of mine idly bought an entire apartment block in Schoneberg for almost nothing. It was incredibly cheap to live there. I was startled to discover that I could pay six weeks&#x2019; rent for a flat in Prenzlauer Berg by writing one book review. In such an atmosphere, people have the time to sit around and talk. To listen, as well. I heard a lot of stories, and came to think of the city as a hatcher of stories, many of which had simply never been told before. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The city has changed a good deal in the twenty years since then. The underground experience I remembered has been packaged up and delivered to the entranced young of Europe by hardnosed corporations. The last time I went to the bar that held the great drag-queen goulash competition, the barman had no time or inclination to talk; my neighbour at the bar was keen to explain how much profit he had made from property. It is, unimaginably, now expensive to live in Prenzlauer Berg, or Kreuzberg, or anywhere in Berlin. <br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the moment, Berlin is in an unexpected imperial phase of expansion and wealth, its pleasures organised and costed up for the prosperous bourgeoisie and their children. Whether it is currently a fruitful subject for the investigation of the imagination is, I think, a question worth debating. The best Berlin fiction of recent years is concerned with outsiders and with the past. Jean-Philippe Toussaint&#x2019;s novel Television, which I extract here, is largely devoted to trying to keep Berlin out of the temporary resident&#x2019;s existence; its idiosyncrasies have a knack of creeping in. Other observers, like Chloe Aridjis, explore the new arrival&#x2019;s necessary and lonely wandering. Finally, one of the most admired of recent German novels, Jenny Erpenbeck&#x2019;s Go Went Gone sets an encounter between German high culture and new arrivals in the always provisional arena of Kreuzberg, in a temporary city of tents and squatting. History is here, but also some sense of the future metropolis, and the obligations of the present day. Right now, in 2019, the overwhelming confidence of the capital city is balanced by a creative uncertainty in its fiction. Nobody could say what new forms of existence, and imagination, are going to arise from the new Berlin, in the process of being created, of becoming. But that has always been the case.</p><h2>The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data (Pelican Books)</h2><p><p>Statistics has played a leading role in our scientific understanding of the world for centuries, yet we are all familiar with the way statistical claims can be sensationalised, particularly in the media. In the age of big data, as data science becomes established as a discipline, a basic grasp of statistical literacy is more important than ever. </p><p>In <i>The Art of Statistics</i>, David Spiegelhalter guides the reader through the essential principles we need in order to derive knowledge from data. Drawing on real world problems to introduce conceptual issues, he shows us how statistics can help us determine the luckiest passenger on the Titanic, whether serial killer Harold Shipman could have been caught earlier, and if screening for ovarian cancer is beneficial. </p><p>How many trees are there on the planet? Do busier hospitals have higher survival rates? Why do old men have big ears? Spiegelhalter reveals the answers to these and many other questions - questions that can only be addressed using statistical science.</p></p><p></p><h2>The End of Liberalism: The Second Republic of the United States</h2><p><p><strong>This widely read book has become a modern classic of political science.</strong></p> The main argument which Lowi develops through this book is that the liberal state grew to its immense size and presence without self-examination and without recognizing that its pattern of growth had problematic consequences. Its engine of growth was delegation. The government expanded by responding to the demands of all major organized interests, by assuming responsibility for programs sought by those interests, and by assigning that responsibility to administrative agencies. Through the process of accommodation, the agencies became captives of the interest groups, a tendency Lowi describes as clientelism. This in turn led to the formulation of new policies which tightened the grip of interest groups on the machinery of government.</p><p>Theodore J. Lowi has been John L. Senior Professor of American Institutions at Cornell University since 1972. He was elected President of the American Political Science Association in 1990 and was cited as the political scientist who made the most significant contribution to the field during the decade of the 1970s. Among his numerous books are The End of Liberalism and The Pursuit of Justice, on which he collaborated with Robert F. Kennedy.</p><h2>The Word Exchange: Anglo-Saxon Poems in Translation</h2><p><p><strong>"A book the many fans of Heaney's <em>Beowulf</em> might take home and dip into, almost at random, for years." &#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em></strong></p> Featuring 123 all-new translations by seventy-four of our most celebrated poets&#x2015;including Seamus Heaney, Robert Pinsky, Billy Collins, Eavan Boland, Richard Wilbur, and many others&#x2015;&#x201c;this brilliant anthology infuses new vigor into Old English poetry&#x201d; (<em>Library Journal</em>).

Born at Mossbawn farmhouse between Castledawson and Toomebridge, County Derry, he resided in Dublin until his death.</p>Starred Review. Hefty and easy to like, fit at once for the classroom and the kitchen table, this anthology is a rare beast, a commercial opportunity that also fulfills a real literary need. Most of the corpus of surviving Anglo-Saxon poetry--though it has been translated before--has had no recent, high-profile rendering until this capacious book. Most of the short poems and passages from all the long ones are rendered into modern English, sometimes (but only sometimes) in Anglo-Saxon alliterative metrical form, by several dozen British, Irish, and American poets of some repute, and the results are consistently good and sometimes stunning. The editors (one Irish but resident in Vermont, one American) do well to mix famous Americans such as Robert Hass with talented poets known mostly across the Atlantic, such as Paul Farley and David Constantine. Delanty and Matto divide their selections by genre--accounts of historical events (mostly battles), charms and recipes, proverbs and advice, lyrical laments, and the famous riddles, broken up into seven &#x153;hoards throughout the book. Anglo-Saxon culture was stark and practical, deeply Christian once converted, and with few illusions about life on Earth: &#x153;Holly must be burned, says a maxim translated by Brigit Kelly, &#x153;and the goods of a dead man divided./ God's judgment will be just. The riddles are sometimes easy, sometimes hard to solve, and many are double entendres: riddle 45 ( &#x153;I saw in a corner something swelling, in Richard Wilbur's version) might be bread dough, or something else. To these light moments--and there are plenty of them--such poems as &#x153;The Damned Soul Address the Body (in Maurice Riordan's choice words) add force and gravity. The editors have produced a book the many fans of Heaney's Beowulf might take home and dip into, almost at random, for years. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Hall s exhaustive research concentrates the teachings of nearly six hundred distinguished authorities on religion and philosophy, bringing to you an interpretation of the themes underlying the ancient mythology, philosophy, religion, rituals, and arcane mysteries of all ages. In its original format designed by J. Henry Nash, this unique volume can be treasured and passed on as an heirloom with the assurance that its in-depth studies of some forty ancient and modern systems of spiritual development can contribute to each to each individual s quest for self-knowledge and philosophical awareness. First published in 1928, this volume includes fifty-four stunning full-page color plates by noted artist J. Augustus Knapp, and two hundred black and white illustrations from rare occult works and manuscripts. To this day it remains unrivaled in its scope, synthesis and graphic beauty; a must for any serious student of mystical philosophy.</p><p>The Philosophical Research Society is a nonprofit organization founded in 1934 for the purpose of assisting thoughtful persons to live more graciously and constructively in a confused and troubled world. The Society is entirely free from educational, political, or ecclesiastical control. Dedicated to an idealistic approach to the solution of human problems, the Society&#39;s program stresses the need for the integration of religion, philosophy, and the science of psychology into one system of instruction. The goal of this instruction is to enable the individual to develop a mature philosophy of life, to recognize his proper responsibilities and opportunities, and to understand and appreciate his place in the unfolding universal pattern.Mystical speculations about God, the world, and man occupied the minds of many medieval scholars and theologians. They conceived creation itself to be a symbol or figure through which the Divine Will manifested its purposes and intentions-thus by analogy, the world revealed God, and man revealed the world. The human being himself was a microcosm-a miniature of the cosmos. After the collapse of the pagan cultural institutions, it was unlawful to teach classical learning or to advance scientific knowledge contrary to the prevailing scholasticism. To avoid persecution and at the same time perpetuate for the benefit of qualified disciples the more advanced formulas of the ancient wisdom, the sacred truths were presented symbolically through the beautiful engraved devices of the emblem writers. <p>The seventeenth century restoration of learning gradually brought about a Universal Reformation as proclaimed in the Fama of the Rosicrucians. A careful study of the emblem books of that period reveals that most of the figures and designs were based upon Egyptian or Greek mythology, and like the alchemical symbols, perpetuated the secret teachings of esoteric fraternities. Today, those well informed in the Orphic Mysteries and the mystical speculations of the Neoplatonists can interpret the design with little difficulty. It appears that the emblem books were, in many cases, actual extensions of Pythagorean and Platonic metaphysics. Paracelsus said that the first hieroglyphic book is nature, published in folio, and the second hieroglyphic book is man, published in duodecimo. </p><p>To live in the world without becoming aware of the meaning of the world is like wandering about in a great library without touching the books. It has always seemed to me that symbolism should be restored to the structure of world education. The young are no longer invited to seek the hidden truths, dynamic and eternal, locked within the shapes and behavior of living beings. </p><p>The present volume is itself a symbol made up of many symbols gathered from rare sources. It invites the thoughtful reader to explore the meanings of these emblems and devices with his own insight. Because spiritual growth is the goal of all human aspiration, symbols that help us to grow are precious things for they open the doors to life everlasting. </p><p>I wish to express my deep indebtedness to those faithful artists and engravers whose remarkable meditation pictures have guided my labors for so many years. This book is dedicated to the truths they served and the wonderful designs which they have bestowed as a priceless heritage upon the truth seekers of the future. It is my sincere hope that this memorial may continue to serve and inspire new generations of kindly and dedicated people. Manly P.

Petronius Arbiter), who is reasonably identified with the author of this famous satyric and satiric novel, was a man of pleasure and of good literary taste who flourished in the times of Claudius (41&#x2013;54 CE) and Nero (54&#x2013;68). As Tacitus describes him, he used to sleep by day, and attend to official duties or to his amusements by night. At one time he was governor of the province of Bithynia in Asia Minor and was also a consul, showing himself a man of vigour when this was required. Later he lapsed into indulgence (or assumed the mask of vice) and became a close friend of Nero. Accused by jealous Tigellinus of disloyalty and condemned, with self-opened veins he conversed lightly with friends, dined, drowsed, sent to Nero a survey of Nero's sexual deeds, and so died, 66 CE.</p><p>The surviving parts of Petronius's romance <i>Satyricon</i> mix philosophy and real life, prose and verse, in a tale of the disreputable adventures of Encolpius and two companions, Ascyltus and Giton. In the course of their wanderings they attend a showy and wildly extravagant dinner given by a rich freedman, Trimalchio, whose guests talk about themselves and life in general. Other incidents are a shipwreck and somewhat lurid proceedings in South Italy. The work is written partly in pure Latin, but sometimes purposely in a more vulgar style. It parodies and otherwise attacks bad taste in literature, pedantry and hollow society.</p><p><i>Apocolocyntosis,</i> "Pumpkinification" (instead of deification), is probably by Seneca the wealthy philosopher and courtier (ca. 4 BCE&#x2013;65 CE).

It is used globally by importers, exporters, investors, governments and central banks alike. Nearly three-quarters of all $100 bills circulate outside the United States. The dollar holdings of the Chinese government alone come to more than $1,000 per Chinese resident.<br> <br>This dependence on dollars, by banks, corporations and governments around the world, is a source of strength for the United States. It is, as a critic of U.S. policies once put it, America's "exorbitant privilege." However, recent events have raised concerns that this soon may be a privilege lost. Among these have been the effects of the financial crisis and the Great Recession: high unemployment, record federal deficits, and financial distress. In addition there is the rise of challengers like the euro and China's renminbi. Some say that the dollar may soon cease to be the world's standard currency--which would depress American living standards and weaken the country's international influence.<br><br>In <em>Exorbitant Privilege,</em> one of our foremost economists, Barry Eichengreen, traces the rise of the dollar to international prominence over the course of the 20th century. He shows how the greenback dominated internationally in the second half of the century for the same reasons--and in the same way--that the United States dominated the global economy. But now, with the rise of China, India, Brazil and other emerging economies, America no longer towers over the global economy. It follows, Eichengreen argues, that the dollar will not be as dominant. But this does not mean that the coming changes will necessarily be sudden and dire--or that the dollar is doomed to lose its international status. Challenging the presumption that there is room for only one true global currency--either the dollar or something else--Eichengreen shows that several currencies have shared this international role over long periods. What was true in the distant past will be true, once again, in the not-too-distant future.<br><br>The dollar will lose its international currency status, Eichengreen warns, only if the United States repeats the mistakes that led to the financial crisis and only if it fails to put its fiscal and financial house in order. The greenback's fate hinges, in other words, not on the actions of the Chinese government but on economic policy decisions here in the United States.<br><br>Incisive, challenging and iconoclastic, <em>Exorbitant Privilege,</em> which was shortlisted for the FT Goldman Sachs 2011 Best Business Book of the Year, is a fascinating analysis of the changes that lie ahead. It is a challenge, equally, to those who warn that the dollar is doomed and to those who regard its continuing dominance as inevitable.<br></p><p><br><strong>Barry Eichengreen</strong> is Professor of Political Science and Economics at the University of California, Berkeley.

Pohl is the Dr. Mary Ann Vanderzyl Reynolds Professor of Humanities and Professor of Art History at Pomona College in Claremont, California. She received her Ph.D. from the University of California, Los Angeles. Since moving to Pomona in 1985, she has taught a wide variety of courses in nineteenth- and twentieth-century North American art. Her work has focused on the art of the United States, in particular the work of Ben Shahn, about whom she has written two books, and the relationship between the visual arts and working-class culture. Professor Pohl has taught in the United States for many years, but her Canadian origins give her a unique continental perspective on American art.Even if the ultimate outcome of the culture wars is still in some dispute, it is clear that revisiting art's "greatest hits," from America or anywhere else, is not sufficient for a basic understanding of art history. Framing America's focus is determinedly and liberatingly inclusive, showing how popular and vernacular arts have had just as great cultural and inspirational impact as the work of trained artists. Pohl, professor of art history at Pomona College, proves her case again and again with revealing juxtapositions and inspired close readings, from the objects plundered by Cort&#x201a;s to those fabricated by Jeff Koons. Native art, folk art and "Outsider" art, as well as many previously neglected female artists and artists of color are present in Pohl's narrative, never as victims of special pleading but as essential components in a vibrant mosaic. An examination of depictions of the Old West introduces to great effect drawings of startling iconic simplicity done by some of the victors of the Battle of Little Big Horn; an account of the construction of the Statue of Liberty is viewed against the Haymarket riot and trials; the Tilted Arc controversy leads to the Vietnam Veterans Memorial. And if the section dealing with recent developments is somewhat more cautious than the rest, Pohl at least steers clear of millennial pronouncements. Written less as a series of static tableaux than as a set of provocations for discussion and exploration, this large, satisfying and beautifully produced volume, with 665 illustrations (half of them in color), will be of value not only to students and scholars, but to anyone interested in the contradictory forces at the heart of American life.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Future of Spacetime</h2><p>A group of leading physicists--Stephen Hawking, Kip S. Thorne, Igor Novikov, Timothy Ferris, and Alan Lightman--paints a vivid portrait of the possible future of black holes, gravity holes, and time travel in six readible essays that explore the deepest mysteries of the universe.</p><p>Stephen W. Hawking is a theoretical physicist and cosmologist. He is an Honorary Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, a lifetime member of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, and in 2009 was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the highest civilian award in the United States.Put Stephen Hawking, Kip Thorne, Igor Novikov, Timothy Ferris and Alan Lightman in a room together, and I would imagine that the intellectual sparks would fly lively and thick. The five essays collected in this book are adapted from those sparks, talks given at the California Institute of Technology in June 2000 to honor the 60th birthday of physicist Kip Thorne. If there is a unifying theme to the essays, it is the possibility of time travel, one of Thorne's obsessions as a theoretician of general relativity and, of course, a topic of perennial popular interest. None of the authors was paid for his contribution, and royalties will go to a Caltech scholarship fund in Thorne's name. Theoretical physicist Igor Novikov starts by asking, "Can we change the past?" He shows how curious foldings and warpings of spacetime apparently allow the possibility of traveling back in time and considers the so-called grandfather paradox: What if I travel back in time and kill my grandfather? Then, logically, I would never have been born to make my journey into the past. Novikov argues that the laws of nature would prevent such logical paradoxes from happening. Stephen Hawking is perhaps the world's most famous theorist of spacetime. He is less sanguine than Novikov that time travel is possible, except on the scale of individual atomic particles, which is not of much use for science-fiction fantasies. If Hawking's take on the physics is correct, grandfather is doubly safe. Thorne uses his commanding presence at the heart of the book to address the question implicit in the title: How will our understanding of spacetime evolve in the near future, theoretically and experimentally? The final two essays, by writers Timothy Ferris and Alan Lightman, though excellent in themselves, have nothing directly to do with the topic at hand. Ferris considers how science is communicated to the general public, and Lightman muses on relations between science and art. It all adds up to less than the sum of its parts. The word "hodgepodge" comes to mind, and the fact that the editors decided the book needed a long preparatory introduction (longer than all but one of the five contributions) and a puffed-up glossary suggests that the problems were apparent from the beginning. Anyone who wants the skinny on time travel and the future of spacetime would do well to go directly to Thorne's excellent popular book Black Holes and Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy (W. W. Norton, 1994). Still, there is a terrific story lurking among the disparate parts of the present volume, but readers will have to dig it out for themselves. I would suggest skipping the introduction and going straight to Lightman's piece on science and art. He was trained as a physicist and has transformed himself into a successful novelist, so he knows both sides of which he speaks. He takes us to the heart of the creative process and shows us what physicists and novelists have in common. For one thing, they both make up stories, and they both want their stories to be true. Ferris tells us why scientific story making is essential to a healthy and free body politic. "Technologically, intellectually, and even politically, science resides somewhere near the center of our culture, by which I mean the society of all those persons who value their freedom, honor their responsibilities, appreciate their ignorance, and are willing to keep learning," he writes. Now go to the essays by Novikov and Hawking and watch two outrageously clever minds at play in the fields of knowledge and ignorance. They take Einstein's supreme story--his theory of gravity and spacetime, called general relativity--and make delightful riffs on the theme. What if? they ask. They agree on this: even if it turns out that time travel is impossible, it is important that we understand why it is impossible. Finally, turn to Thorne's central essay, where it all comes together. We have in Einstein's legacy a fabulously inventive story: black holes, time travel, ripples in spacetime, the big bang--stuff any novelist would have been proud to invent. But the story must be put to the experimental test, and so far general relativity has passed muster. Soon new tests of a most exquisite sensitivity will come on line, and these are the focus of Thorne's crystal-ball gazing. The Laser Interferometer Gravitational Wave Observatory (LIGO)--three huge instruments at Hanford, Wash., and Livingston, La.--and similar devices in Italy, Germany and Japan promise the possibility of detecting gravitational waves rippling through spacetime from colossal events (imploding stars, colliding black holes, even the big bang itself) unfolding across the universe. Then, sometime around 2010 if physicists get their way, the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) will be launched into space. Three intercommunicating spacecraft arrayed across millions of kilometers of the solar system, bobbing like corks in water as gravitational waves roll by, will map in fine detail the bending of space, the warping of time, and the whirl of spacetime around distant black holes. LISA will detect ripples in spacetime as small as one hundredth the diameter of an atom. What a story! What a test! This is story making that lifts the human spirit out of our sometimes petty terrestrial concerns and places us among the stars. <p><i>Chet Raymo is emeritus professor at Stonehill College in Massachusetts and a science columnist for the Boston Globe.</i></p></p><h2>Becoming Dickens: The Invention of a Novelist</h2><p><p><i>Becoming Dickens</i> tells the story of how an ambitious young Londoner became England&#x2019;s greatest novelist. In following the twists and turns of Charles Dickens&#x2019;s early career, Robert Douglas-Fairhurst examines a remarkable double transformation: in reinventing himself Dickens reinvented the form of the novel. It was a high-stakes gamble, and Dickens never forgot how differently things could have turned out. Like the hero of<i> Dombey and Son</i>, he remained haunted by &#x201c;what might have been, and what was not.&#x201d;</p><p>In his own lifetime, Dickens was without rivals. He styled himself simply &#x201c;The Inimitable.&#x201d; But he was not always confident about his standing in the world. From his traumatized childhood to the suicide of his first collaborator and the sudden death of the woman who had a good claim to being the love of his life, Dickens faced powerful obstacles. Before settling on the profession of novelist, he tried his hand at the law and journalism, considered a career in acting, and even contemplated emigrating to the West Indies. Yet with <i>The Pickwick Papers</i>, <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and a groundbreaking series of plays, sketches, and articles, he succeeded in turning every potential breakdown into a breakthrough.</p><p>Douglas-Fairhurst&#x2019;s provocative new biography, focused on the 1830s, portrays a restless and uncertain Dickens who could not decide on the career path he should take and would never feel secure in his considerable achievements.</p></p><p>Robert Douglas-Fairhurst is Professor of English Literature and a Fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford.&#x201c;Rightly rejecting familiar accounts of Dickens's life, Douglas-Fairhurst's biography shows us the forlorn and driven young Dickens, restless and uncertain, who could not yet choose what was to become his inevitable mode of composing fiction. I recommend it highly.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Harold Bloom</b><br><br>&#x201c;Douglas-Fairhurst offers an original perspective on Dickens's early life and writing as Dickens works through the choices before him in pursuit of a voice and style he could confidently claim as his own.... a fresh and insightful study, moving and exceptionally well-written... a book to be valued by a range of readers, and one certain to stand the test of time.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>David Paroissien, University of Massachusetts, Amherst</b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Becoming Dickens</i> never takes Dickens for granted, but helps us to be surprised--shocked even--that he existed, worked and wrote in the way that he did.

Montgomery's <i>Anne of Green Gables.</i></b><br><br>A new edition of L. M. Montgomery's <i>Anne of Green Gables</i> in honor of the hundredth-year anniversary of the enduring classic. <br><br> In addition to publishing <i>Before Green Gables</i>, we are issuing a special collectible edition of <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, which will be a facsimile of the 1908 version and will feature the original cover art. <br><br> Old and new fans alike will revel in this elegant keepsake of the timeless classic.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history. This lovely boxed gift collection comprises <i>Anne of Green Gables</i>, <i>Anne of the Island</i>, <i>Anne of Avonlea</i>, <i>Anne of Windy Poplars</i>, <i>Anne's House of Dreams</i>, <i>Anne of Ingleside</i>, <i>Rainbow Valley</i>, and <i>Rilla of Ingleside</i>. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i>Now even the youngest Anne of Green Gables fans can celebrate the centennial anniversary.</p><h2>Interpreter&#39;s Rx</h2><p>The Interpreter&#39;s Rx teaches Spanish-English interpreting in a medical context.

The choices range from the seafood of the rocky coasts to the rich meats from inland, and the fabulous herbs and vegetables, cheeses, breads and desserts that are everywhere. Geography and history are responsible for such exotic accents as saffron-- Sicily's is the finest in the world-- and almonds, jasmine and honey.<br><br>Here, then, are recipes for lamb cooked with saffron and artichokes, sweet peas with mint, calamari stuffed with pasta, tuna in a vinegar sauce, and gelato scented with jasmine. Bugialli also offers photo essays on Palermo's tumultuous Vucciria, one of the world's outstanding food markets; local festivals; tuna fishing off the coast of Sicily; and the baking of the ancient bread called <i>carta da musica</i>.<br><br>The glorious photography was made on location, with ancient ruins, fishing boats, rugged landscapes, cathedrals, village streets and bustling markets providing the settings for the food. The photographer, John Dominis, also collaborated with the author on the hugely successful <i>Foods of Italy</i>, <i>Foods of Tuscany</i> and <i>Bugialli on Pasta</i>.<br></p><p><b>Giuliano Bugialli </b>teaches at his school, a 15th-century villa outside Florence and at prestigious cooking schools all across the United States. He is author of: <i>Classic Techniques of Italian Cooking</i>; <i>The Fine Art of Italian Cooking</i>; <i>Foods of Italy</i>; <i>Foods of Tuscany</i>; <i>Bugialli on Pasta</i>. He lives in New York and Italy.<br><br><b>John Dominis</b>, an award-winning photographer, was on the staff of <i>Life</i> for twenty years and has been picture editor at <i>People</i> and <i>Sports Illustrated</i>. He has collaborated with Giuliano Bugialli on three previous books.<br>Charting watery frontiers of authentic Italian cuisine, Bugialli (The Foods of Tuscany) island-hops to observe ancient Roman culinary traditions steeped in encounters with Greek, Phoenician, French, Spanish and other historic trespassers. The galvanic flavors retrieved justify his every stopover. Claiming that Sicily and Sardinia boast Italy's most varied antipasti, Bugialli offers Swordfish or Tuna Marinated in Aromatic Herbs (lemon verbena, mint, basil, parsley, sage, rosemary, oregano and capers) and Grilled Eggplant in Salmoriglio, a sauce of anchovies, garlic, rosemary and sage. Sicilian Pesto fuses tomatoes, almonds, garlic, basil, parsley and mint. On the tiny island of Favignana, he finds Pasta Baked in a Squid. Some dishes specify homemade pasta, which may scare off many home cooks; Polenta with Sausages, Sardinian Style, asks for 55 minutes of pot-stirring, a long stretch even for old polenta hands. But simple recipes, like Fava Bean Soup with spinach and pancetta or prosciutto, are also offered. Lemon-Flavored Ossobuco with Cannellini Beans from Elba is particularly seductive, as is Chicken with Hot Green Peppers. Expectedly, seafood dishes excel with dishes like Shrimp in Tomato/Caper Sauce and Fresh Tuna in Savory Vinegar Sauce. So too do vegetables (String Beans in Garlic Sauce; Savory Squash Torte). Breads include Sardinia's classic Carta da Musica (Music Paper Bread). Dominis's lush photos portray the islands, their marketplaces and traditions with remarkable immediacy. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>What the Best MBAs Know: How to Apply the Greatest Ideas Taught in the Best Business Schools</h2><p><p><b>Easy access to the essential knowledge and skills of a top-level M.B.A. program--without having to attend a lecture</b></p> <p><i>What the Best MBAs Know </i>provides professionals who don't have the coveted M.B.A. designation with the skills and knowledge taught in today's finest programs.

She captures the human face of the front lines, revealing both the visible and the hidden realities of war in the twenty-first century. <i>Shadows of War </i>is grounded in ethnographic research carried out at the epicenters of political violence on several continents. Its pages are populated not only with the perpetrators and victims of war but also with the scoundrels, silent heroes, and average families who live their lives in the midst of explosive violence. War reconfigures our most basic notions of humanity, Nordstrom demonstrates. This book, of crucial importance at the present moment, shows that war is enmeshed in struggles over the very foundations of the sovereign state, the crafting of economic empires both legal and illegal, and innovative searches for peace. <br><br>Nordstrom describes the multi-trillion-dollar international financial networks that support warfare. She traces the entangled routes by which illegal drugs, precious gems, weapons, basic food supplies, and pharmaceuticals are moved by an international cast of businesspeople, profiteers, and black-market operators. <i>Shadows of War </i>demonstrates how the experiences of both the architects of war and of ordinary people are deleted from media accounts and replaced with stories about soldiers, weapons, and territory. For the first time, this book retrieves from the shadows the faces of those whose stories seldom reach the light of international recognition.</p><p>"This should be made into a movie!"&#x2015;Katia Lund, Co-director of <i>City of God</i><br><br>"Carolyn Nordstrom destroys the categories through which we normally look at war. This is a major achievement. Her eyewitness reporting, when contrasted with the official histories later compiled of the same events, is a revelation. The amount of 'extra-state' activity surrounding any war is vast, and Nordstrom evokes and analyzes it so fully, so deftly, that no one who reads this book will look at war news quite the same way again. Meanwhile, the extra-state itself, typified by Al Qaeda, has begun to drive world politics and generate wars with terrifying success."&#x2015;William Finnegan, author of <i>A Complicated War: The Harrowing of Mozambique</i><br><br>"A gripping account of what the author calls 'research into the shadows' -- the often dangerous world of the powerful and wealthy who inhabit global extra-governmental organizations. It is also about the dehumanizing effects of war and violence on the victims. Nordstrom says: 'It is the only way I know how to write about war: being there.' This book provides a rare opportunity of 'being there' with a courageous and highly observant anthropologist. I recommend it highly."&#x2015;Richard Goldstone, Former Chief Prosecutor of the International War Crimes Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda<br><br>"Carolyn Nordstrom, a pioneer in warzone ethnography, gives us an up-close view of the shadowy worlds of wartime economics. Money laundering, blood diamonds, gun running -- Nordstrom puts faces on each of these. Seeing the faces makes the moral dilemmas of war not simpler, but more realistic. This is an innovative and important book."&#x2015;Cynthia Enloe, author of Maneuvers: The International Politics of Militarizing Women's Lives<br><br>"Nordstrom is a compassionate scholar who simply and doggedly uses ethnography to follow the question. This approach takes Nordstrom from the spectacular violence of armed conflict--the flames and mobs and murder--to the even more destructive but hidden structural violence--the 'shadows' that few seek to understand. This is engaged, urgent scholarship at its best."&#x2015;Paul Farmer, M.D., author of <i>Pathologies of Power</i><b>Carolyn Nordstrom </b>is Associate Professor of Anthropology at the University of Notre Dame.

Arthur Danto, one of the best-known art critics of his time, presents radical insights into art's irrevocable deviation from its previous course and the decline of traditional aesthetics. He demonstrates the necessity for a new type of criticism in the face of contemporary art&#x2019;s wide-open possibilities. This Princeton Classics edition includes a new foreword by philosopher Lydia Goehr.</p></p><p><b>Arthur C. Danto</b> (1924&#x2013;2013) was the Johnsonian Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at Columbia University and art critic for the <i>Nation</i> from 1984 to 2009.

Kayden National University Press Book Prize, University of Colorado at Boulder"</b><br><br>"Required reading for anyone seriously interested in late-modern and contemporary art." (<i>Library Journal</i>)<br><br>"Is Danto gloomy about the end of art? Not in the slightest. . . . Danto is nothing if not cheered by the prospect of an art world in which everything is permitted."<b>---Roger Copeland, <i>Wilson Quarterly</i></b><br><br>"If you are seriously attentive to contemporary art, you are already aware of Danto and his general positions, and owe it to yourself to read this book. If you are not, but are genuinely curious, you would do well to follow him. . . . Throughout it is clear and direct; at best, it is brilliantly crystalline. . . . I know of no more useful single book on art today."<b>---Michael Pakenham, <i>Baltimore Sun</i></b><br><br>"In this, Dr. Danto's best book yet, he helps us make sense of the times we are living in."<b>---Richard Dorment, <i>The Art Newspaper</i></b><br><br>"Danto makes a lively and stimulating case [about the end of art]. . . . The source . . . of all ths mental labor is Andy Warhol, or more precisely his Brillo box sculpture. . . . The utter banality of the piece sent 600 years of art history crashing to the ground in ruins." (<i>Boston Book Review</i>)<br><br>"Danto was and remains the high priest of pluralism, and arch-critic of the view that art has a distinctive essence. . . . The chapters in this book are a challenging read, but a good one, because they take us to the heart of a living and profoundly interesting contemporary debate."<b>---A.C.

She depicts the personal tragedies and the small acts of courage and reconciliation that grow from the deep-rooted conflict between Arabs and Jews, women and men, and older and younger generations in present-day Israel. These stories create a finely nuanced portrait of contemporary Israel; at the same time, they reach toward truths that know no national boundaries. As Lily Rattok writes in her introduction, Liebrecht&#x2019;s skill as a writer, combined with her perceptiveness, her compassion, and her deep humanity, create a body of work that is a testament to the healing power of storytelling.&#x201d;</p><p>"Months afterwards she would remember that morning with dismay, when she had sat with them for the first time, as though they were at home there: drinking from cups like welcome guests ... and only the part of her, the part that didn't laugh with them, thought: Could these hands, serving coffee, be the ones that planted the booby-trapped doll at the gate of the religious school at the end of the street?" <p> In the stories of Israeli author Savyon Liebrecht, personal relationships can't help but become political. In "A Room on the Roof," an unnamed Jewish woman hires three Arab workers to build an addition onto her house while her husband is out of the country. So paralyzed is she by her fear of <i>Arabs</i>, she is unable to recognize the essential decency of these particular men; on the rare occasions when she <i>is</i> able to see past her own blind bigotry, the realization that her workmen are human beings with their own set of hopes, fears, and prejudices is so terrifying that she becomes even more strident in her intolerance. </p><p> Though a few of the stories in <i>Apples from the Desert</i> are directly concerned with interactions between Jews and Arabs, the collection is, in fact, more about how Israelis deal with each other. The Holocaust is the unmentioned elephant in the drawing room, for Liebrecht, herself the daughter of concentration camp survivors, is particularly interested in the impact that tragedy has had on the children of survivors. In "Hayuta's Engagement Party," everyone fears that Grandpa, a Holocaust survivor, will ruin this festive occasion (as he has many others) with his grim recitals of death-camp atrocities. The protagonist of "'What Am I Speaking, Chinese?' She Said to Him" returns to her childhood home in Poland in order to stage a sexual encounter in the same room where her parents--again Holocaust survivors--once argued about sex. </p><p> If the Holocaust is one theme running through most of these stories, the position of women in modern Israeli society is another. Many of the women--especially older ones--in Liebrecht's stories are in oppressive marriages with men who neglect, ridicule, and sometimes physically abuse them. In "Compassion," a Jewish woman who was hidden from the Nazis in a Catholic convent as a child marries an Arab man who eventually imprisons her and takes a younger wife. Victoria, the mother of a rebellious daughter in the collection's title story, only recognizes the depths of her own marital misery when she sees the loving relationship her child has formed outside the legal bonds of matrimony. </p><p> There is nothing subtle about Liebrecht's stories, and readers accustomed to the finely tuned ironies of an Ann Beattie or Alice Munro may find these stories a trifle emphatic. However, anyone interested in the literature coming out of Israel today will find Savyon Liebrecht's window on the land and the people illuminating, if sometimes uncomfortable reading.</p><b>Savyon Liebrecht</b> was born in Germany in 1948 and moved to Israel as a young child. She is the author of the story collections <i>Apples From The Desert</i>, <i>Horses On The Highway</i>, <i>"What Am I Speaking, Chinese?" He Said To Her</i>, and <i>On Love Stories And Other Endings</i>, published in Hebrew. Her selected stories have also been published in German, Italian, and Chinese.<br></p><h2>Nancy Cunard: Heiress, Muse, Political Idealist</h2><p>Lois Gordon's absorbing biography tells the story of a writer, activist, and cultural icon who embodied the dazzling energy and tumultuous spirit of her age, and whom William Carlos Williams once called "one of the major phenomena of history."<br><br>Nancy Cunard (1896-1965) led a life that surpasses Hollywood fantasy. The only child of an English baronet (and heir to the Cunard shipping fortune) and an American beauty, Cunard abandoned the world of a celebrated socialite and Jazz Age icon to pursue a lifelong battle against social injustice as a wartime journalist, humanitarian aid worker, and civil rights champion.<br><br>Cunard fought fascism on the battlefields of Spain and reported firsthand on the atrocities of the French concentration camps. Intelligent and beautiful, she romanced the great writers of her era, including three Nobel Prize winners, and was the inspiration for characters in the works of Ezra Pound, T. S. Eliot, Aldous Huxley, Pablo Neruda, Samuel Beckett, and Ernest Hemingway, among others. <br><br>Cunard was also a prolific poet, publisher, and translator and, after falling in love with a black American jazz pianist, became deeply committed to fighting for black rights. She edited the controversial anthology <i>Negro</i>, the first comprehensive study of the achievement and plight of blacks around the world. Her contributors included Langston Hughes, W. E. B. Du Bois, and Zora Neale Hurston, among scores of others.<br><br>Cunard's personal life was as complex as her public persona. Her involvement with the civil rights movement led her to be ridiculed and rejected by both family and friends. Throughout her life, she was plagued by insecurities and suffered a series of breakdowns, struggling with a sense of guilt over her promiscuous behavior and her ability to survive so much war and tragedy. Yet Cunard's writings also reveal an immense kindness and wit, as well as her renowned, often flamboyant defiance of prejudiced social conventions.<br><br>Drawing on diaries, correspondence, historical accounts, and the remembrances of others, Lois Gordon revisits the major movements of the first half of the twentieth century through the life of a truly gifted and extraordinary woman. She also returns Nancy Cunard to her rightful place as a major figure in the historical, social, and artistic events of a critical era.</p><p><p>A fascinating and moving biography of a writer, activist, and cultural icon who embodied the dazzling energy and tumultuous spirit of her age. </p>Lois Gordon, distinguished professor of English at Fairleigh Dickinson University, is internationally known for her work in drama and American culture. She is the author of the first book in the United States on Harold Pinter, and her most recent books include <i>Pinter at 70</i>; <i>The World of Samuel Beckett, 1906-1946</i>; <i>Reading Godot</i>; and <i>American Chronicle: Year by Year Through the Twentieth Century</i>, a classic reference on American culture.</p><h2>The Frontier in American Culture</h2><p>Log cabins and wagon trains, cowboys and Indians, Buffalo Bill and General Custer. These and other frontier images pervade our lives, from fiction to films to advertising, where they attach themselves to products from pancake syrup to cologne, blue jeans to banks. Richard White and Patricia Limerick join their inimitable talents to explore our national preoccupation with this uniquely American image.<br><br>Richard White examines the two most enduring stories of the frontier, both told in Chicago in 1893, the year of the Columbian Exposition. One was Frederick Jackson Turner's remarkably influential lecture, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History"; the other took place in William "Buffalo Bill" Cody's flamboyant extravaganza, "The Wild West." Turner recounted the peaceful settlement of an empty continent, a tale that placed Indians at the margins. Cody's story put Indians&#x2015;and bloody battles&#x2015;at center stage, and culminated with the Battle of the Little Bighorn, popularly known as "Custer's Last Stand." Seemingly contradictory, these two stories together reveal a complicated national identity.<br><br>Patricia Limerick shows how the stories took on a life of their own in the twentieth century and were then reshaped by additional voices&#x2015;those of Indians, Mexicans, African-Americans, and others, whose versions revisit the question of what it means to be an American.<br><br>Generously illustrated, engagingly written, and peopled with such unforgettable characters as Sitting Bull, Captain Jack Crawford, and Annie Oakley, <i>The Frontier in American Culture</i> reminds us that despite the divisions and denials the western movement sparked, the image of the frontier unites us in surprising ways.</p><p>"In this beautifully illustrated volume, two of the nation's leading western historians offer brilliant and provocative insight into why the frontier has had such a longstanding and problematic hold on American national thought. Their book is a pleasure both to read and to look at and deserves a wide audience."--William Cronon, Frederick Jackson Turner Professor of History, University of Wisconsin, Madison<p>"The authors . . . demonstrate a keen awareness of the critical and complex relationship between history and legend in the American West and its consequences for modern Americans. Finely crafted with scholarship and good humor, their thoughtful and provocative ruminations lend fresh insight into the shaping and propagation of America's frontier legacy."--B.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>Giorgio Bassani's masterwork has Vittorio de Sica's 1971 film adaptation to thank for its dual success and obscurity. Not enough people know that this tale of a middle-class Jewish youth's obsession with the far more aristocratic Micol Finzi-Contini stems from a novel, not a novelization. Bassani's doom- and tomb-ridden examination of one-sided love is far more complex--about individuals' inability to contend with personal and political annihilation. Events call for heroism, yet it seems "downright absurd that now, all of a sudden, exceptional behavior was demanded of us." The narrator writes in retrospect, 13 years after World War II's end, and reveals the Finzi-Continis' 1943 deportation to Germany right from the start: "Who could say if they found any sort of burial at all?" <p> As Fascist racial laws go from strength to strength, the family, which had long isolated itself from the other inhabitants of Ferrara, opens its walled grounds and tennis court to other young Jews and even returns to the local temple. Unfortunately, the situation encourages the narrator's dream that Micol will return his love, and she is forced into cruel honesty. "She looked into my eyes, and her gaze entered me, straight, sure, hard: with the limpid inexorability of a sword." </p><p> The author has re-created a tragic era in which even nobility could not outrun events, let alone admit they needed to. (For a nonfiction account of the fates of five Italian Jewish families under fascism, see Alexander Stille's <i>Benevolence and Betrayal</i>.) Bassani's elision of historical and personal agony is furthermore superbly translated by William Weaver. All is foretold in the novel's Manzonian epigraph, "The heart, to be sure, always has something to say about what is to come, to him who heeds it. But what does the heart know? Only a little of what has already happened."</p><p>Giorgio Bassani was born in 1916. From 1938 onwards he became involved in various anti-fascist activities for which he was imprisoned in 1943. His works include <i>The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles</i>, and <i>Five Stories of Ferrara (Within the Walls)</i>, which won the Strega Prize. <i>The Garden of the Finzi-Continis</i> was awarded the Viareggio Prize in 1962 and was made into a feature film. <br><br>William Weaver was an award-winning poet and translator. He died in 2013.</p></p><h2>A Dictionary of Selected Synonyms in the Principal Indo-European Languages: A Contribution to the History of Ideas</h2><p>Originally published in 1949 and appearing now for the first time in a paperbound edition, Buck's <i>Dictionary</i> remains an indispensable tool for diachronic analysis of the Indo-European languages. Arranged according to the meaning of words, the work contains more than 1,000 groupings of synonyms from the principal Indo-European languages. Buck first tabulates the words describing a particular concept and then discusses their etymological and semantic history, tracing changes in meaning of the root words as well as presenting cases indicating which of the older forms have been replaced by expressions of colloquial or foreign origin.</p><p></p><h2>The Healthy Aging Brain: Sustaining Attachment, Attaining Wisdom (Norton Series on Interpersonal Neurobiology)</h2><p><p><strong>A neuroscientifically based account of how our brains age and change over time.</strong></p> What would you do if you could live to 122, like the Frenchwoman Madame Calment, whose life span is the oldest ever recorded? What if you could do so and stave off dementia, Alzheimer&#x2019;s, and other common ailments of aging? What would happen if we stopped thinking of ourselves as aging and in decline, and instead started thinking of ourselves as chronologically advantaged? More effective than age-defying creams and anti-aging pills is a concrete understanding of how our bodies and our brains age, and what we can do to work with this natural process to make life as long and as fulfilling as possible. This is just what <em>The Healthy Aging Brain</em> offers. Here, expert psychologist and veteran therapist Louis Cozolino reveals that groundbreaking brain research proves that our brains continue to grow and change throughout our lives. He offers a neuroscientifically-based account of just how our brains age and evolve over time. In short, Cozolino says, our individual health and longevity are inextricably linked to those around us. How we age is grounded in our human relationships.</p><p><strong>Louis Cozolino, PhD</strong>, is professor of psychology at Pepperdine University and a clinician in private practice. He lives in Los Angeles, California.&#x201c;[E]xtremely well-written and communicates complex topics in a very understandable and entertaining manner. . . .

This book, reassures readers that mental deterioration need not accompany growing old, and to that end, Cozolino even provides an appendix listing 52 different activities to keep older brains vibrant.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>The Scientist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;This is the third book by Louis Cozolino that I have had the privilege to read and review. Each is golden in its own way....and I would recommend this book as well; not only to understand the brain and how it functions, but also because of the wisdom contained in it.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Journal of Canadian Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</em></strong></p><h2>Behind The Short Story: From First To Final Draft</h2><p>Behind the Short Story provides the &#34;;inside scoop&#34;; on how a successful story emerges from first to final draft by compiling critical analysis techniques, writing exercises, representative stories, and useful insights into the writing process from award-winning, student-oriented teachers who are also successful short story writers.

Looking in detail at all of the Jewish messiahs about whom anything is known, he introduces each of these figures in turn, and offers extensive excerpts of the original texts that tell their stories. The messiahs whom we meet in these pages range from the inspiring to the tragic and bizarre. By examining the messianic idea in the tradition which gave birth to it, Lenowitz both sheds new light on this engrossing aspect of Jewish history and provides a firmer basis for understanding contemporary messianic groups.<br></p><p>Harris Lenowitz is at University of Utah.<br>"Whereas we deal mostly with Jesus as Christian Messiah, theological entity, artistic representation, etc., Harris Lenowitz, professor of Hebrew, provides a different and thought-provoking context to messianism and the concept of messiah...In addition to the academic merits of the book, Lenowitz produces genuine pleasure for the reader with his choice of translations by others and his own rendering of messiah texts. These translations evoke the emotion and mystery surrounding these mythical figures with their hazy beginnings and seemingly futile ends."--<em>Sixteenth Century Journal</em><p></p><br>"Rare sources are translated here, providing new insights into figures known primarily from the work of Gershom Scholem. Lenowitz has synthesized and presented in an accessible and reliable form many such texts, making this volume the standard English-language handbook on the subject."--<em>Religious</em> <em>Studies Review</em><p></p><br>"This is the first text in English that focuses on primary texts relating to messianism as an active force in Jewish history...Lenowitz's study enriches the material available in English documenting messianic activism in Jewish experience. This material, and the provocative interpretation framing it, may point the way to studies comparing Christian and Muslim millenarian movements, and to further probing of the Jewish sources."--<em>The Jewish Quarterly Review</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Jewish Messiahs</em> is a detailed academic work that will be most useful to students of Jewish history and thought."--<em>Fort Worth Star-Telegram</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Summer Bridge Activities 7th to 8th Grade Workbook, Math, Reading Comprehension, Writing, Science, Social Studies, Fitness Summer Learning Activities, 8th Grade Workbooks All Subjects With Flash Cards</h2><p><p><strong>AWARD-WINNING WORKBOOK:</strong> Summer Bridge Activities is the recipient of the 2018 Kids' Product of the Year Award and Travel Fun of the Year Award from "Creative Child Magazine."

However, narratives about the &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; Greek and Roman empires&nbsp;resisting the barbarians at the gate&nbsp;are far from accurate. Tony Spawforth, an esteemed scholar, author, and media contributor, follows the thread of civilization through more than six millennia of history. His story reveals that Greek and Roman civilization, to varying degrees, was supremely and surprisingly receptive to external influences, particularly from the East.<br> &nbsp;<br> From the rise of the Mycenaean world of the sixteenth century B.C., Spawforth traces a path through the ancient Aegean to the zenith of the Hellenic state and the rise of the Roman empire, the coming of Christianity and the consequences of the first caliphate. Deeply informed, provocative, and entirely fresh, this is the first and only accessible work that tells the extraordinary story of the classical world in its entirety.</p><p><b>Tony Spawforth</b> is emeritus professor of ancient history at Newcastle University, presenter of eight archaeological documentaries in the &#x201c;Ancient Voices&#x201d; series on BBC2, and author of numerous books, including <i>Greece and the Augustan Cultural Revolution.</i>&#x201c;A welcome survey of the two greatest powers in the ancient Mediterranean world and their bound destinies. . . .

Long hailed as one of the most comprehensive and richly detailed chronologies of painting, sculpture, and architecture in Italy from c. 1200 AD to c. 1594 AD, this text focuses on the works of art, their creators, and the circumstances affecting their creation. This revision is designed to provide students with a more streamlined approach to understanding Italian Renaissance art without losing the enthusiasm and appreciation that Hartt demonstrated for this area and which earlier editions of this book conveyed so successfully to generations of students. The text is organized first of all chronologically, with individual chapters dedicated to developments in different areas or cities, such as Florence, Tuscany, Rome, Venice, and North Italy. There is a strong emphasis on understanding the works of individual artists as examples of their specific approach and style.</p><p>Long hailed as one of the most comprehensive and richly detailed chronologies of painting, sculpture, and architecture in Italy from c. 1200 A.D. to c. 1594 A. D., this volume focuses on the works of art, their creators, and the circumstances affecting their creation.<p> Frederick Hartt's <i>History of Italian Renaissance Art</i> remains an unrivaled classic. As absorbing to read as it is authoritative in content, the book covers over four centuries of Italian painting, sculpture, and architecture. Its sumptuous color illustrations, fine writing, and in-depth scholarship bring into focus all the elements of this extraordinarily creative period and the amazing personalities who gave it life. Building on the book's more than thirty-year tradition, revising author David G. Wilkins skillfully blends new scholarly discoveries with Hartt's original emphasis on stylistic developments between the twelfth and sixteenth centuries. Wilkins's approach retains the enthusiasm and appreciation that Hartt so successfully conveyed to generations of students and admirers of Italian Renaissance art. </p> <p> The fifth edition has a striking new design with more than half the works of art now illustrated in color. A lavish color portfolio of the Italian Renaissance opens the book and launches the reader on a dazzling adventure across time. New views of frescoes and sculptures photographed in their original locations offer a dynamic insight into the way Renaissance men and women experienced their art. Since the release of the fourth edition, many more works have been restored, including Michelangelo's <i>Last Judgment</i> in the Sistine Chapel and Raphael's Stanze frescoes in the Vatican. Fresh views of renowned works are included with art commissioned or produced by women. Extended captions identify Renaissance patrons and provide details about historical context, emphasizing how art was created and why, while in-depth visual analysis clarifies the aesthetic developments that emerged in key artistic centers such as Florence, Rome, Venice, and Siena. New iconographic diagrams and computerized reconstructions add dimension to the meanings behind classical, secular, and sacred motifs. Architectural plans, maps in color, and an expanded glossary and bibliography complete this well-rounded picture of the Italian Renaissance. </p> <p> Frederick Hartt and David Wilkins's <i>History of Italian Renaissance Art</i> invites us to experience a rich artistic legacy in painting, sculpture, and architecture. Through an engaging narrative complemented by a cascade of illustrations, Hartt and Wilkins connect us with the remarkable artists whose innovations and visions shaped the Renaissance. </p></p><h2>Summary of the Plant Paradox: The Hidden Dangers in Healthy Food that Cause Disease and Weight Gain</h2><p><p><strong>Summary Of The Plant Paradox: The Hidden Dangers in Healthy Foods That Cause Disease and Weight Gain By Dr. Steven Gundry</strong><br></p><p><strong></strong><br></p><p><b>&#x201c;<em>Eat your food as your medicine or, you&#x2019;ll have to eat medicine as your food</em>.&#x201d;<br></b></p><p><br></p><p>This statement from an unknown source has been quoted many times over.

Eric Weitz has written the authoritative history that this fascinating and complex period deserves, and he illuminates the uniquely progressive achievements and even greater promise of the Weimar Republic. Weitz reveals how Germans rose from the turbulence and defeat of World War I and revolution to forge democratic institutions and make Berlin a world capital of avant-garde art. He explores the period&#x2019;s groundbreaking cultural creativity, from architecture and theater, to the new field of "sexology"&#x2015;and presents richly detailed portraits of some of the Weimar&#x2019;s greatest figures. <i>Weimar Germany</i> also shows that beneath this glossy veneer lay political turmoil that ultimately led to the demise of the republic and the rise of the radical Right. Yet for decades after, the Weimar period continued to powerfully influence contemporary art, urban design, and intellectual life&#x2015;from Tokyo to Ankara, and Brasilia to New York. Featuring a new preface, this comprehensive and compelling book demonstrates why Weimar is an example of all that is liberating and all that can go wrong in a democracy.</p><p><b>Eric D.

The authors of <i>The Reasoned Schemer</i> believe that logic programming is a natural extension of functional programming, and they demonstrate this by extending the functional language Scheme with logical constructs--thereby combining the benefits of both styles. The extension encapsulates most of the ideas in the logic programming language Prolog. The pedagogical method of <i>The Reasoned Schemer</i> is a series of questions and answers, which proceed with the characteristic humor that marked <i>The Little Schemer</i> and <i>The Seasoned Schemer</i>. Familiarity with a functional language or with the first eight chapters of <i>The Little Schemer</i> is assumed. Adding logic capabilities required the introduction of new forms. The authors' goal is to show to what extent writing logic programs is the same as writing functional programs using these forms. In this way, the reader of <i>The Reasoned Schemer</i> will come to understand how simple logic programming is and how easy it is to define functions that behave like relations.</p></p><p><p>Oleg Kiselyov is a computer scientist from Monterey, California.</p>"The Little books are unique in the way they combine deep and subtle ideas with hands-on humorous presentation. "The Reasoned Schemer, " the latest book in the series, is no exception. Friedman, Byrd, and Kiselyov provide a unique presentation of many of the ideas behind logic programming, which is developed as a natural--though subtle--extension of functional programming. For perfecting your programming skills and style you cannot do better than sit at the feet of Friedman and Kiselyov."--Ehud Lamm, Founder of 'Lambda the Ultimate, ' the programming languages weblog<br><br>"Contrary to popular belief, logic programming doesn't always mean programming in Prolog. In this groundbreaking book, Friedman and Kiselyov extend Scheme to form a completely new kind of logic programming system, one which is in many ways even more elegant than Prolog. Written in the same classic question-and-answer format as the authors' previous book "The Little Schemer, The Reasoned Schemer" covers goals, first-class relations, interleaved and non-interleaved backtracking, the relationship between relational and functional programming, and much more. Reading this book will not only cause your geek rating to skyrocket and impress all the Cool Kids, it will also open your eyes to a paradigm of programming which most programmers are completely unaware of, but which will undoubtedly play a significant role in the programming systems of the future. More importantly, though, this book is great fun to read and will make you a better programmer."--Michael Vanier, Caltech<br><br>"Some programmers are particularly fascinated by new ways of thinking about programming and computation. But few programmers have much experience with logic programming, and fewer still understand its essence.

Graham Burnett tells the fascinating story of the transformation of cetaceans from grotesque monsters, useful only as wallowing kegs of fat and fertilizer, to playful friends of humanity, bellwethers of environmental devastation, and, finally, totems of the counterculture in the Age of Aquarius. When Burnett opens his story, ignorance reigns: even <i>Nature</i> was misclassifying whales at the turn of the century, and the only biological study of the species was happening in gruesome Arctic slaughterhouses. But in the aftermath of World War I, an international effort to bring rational regulations to the whaling industry led to an explosion of global research&#x2014;and regulations that, while well-meaning, were quashed, or widely flouted, by whaling nations, the first shot in a battle that continues to this day. The book closes with a look at the remarkable shift in public attitudes toward whales that began in the 1960s, as environmental concerns and new discoveries about whale behavior combined to make whales an object of sentimental concern and public adulation. <br><br>A sweeping history, grounded in nearly a decade of research, <i>The Sounding of the Whale</i> tells a remarkable story of how science, politics, and simple human wonder intertwined to transform the way we see these behemoths from below. </p></p><p><b>D.

By turns enlightening, lively and disturbing, always intuitive and drawing on a wealth of knowledge as vast as its subject, Burnett&#x2019;s book is set to become a new high water mark in a still unfolding story."</p> (Philip Hoare, author of The Whale)<br><br><p>"It is tempting to use big words to describe this big book--and Burnett's <i>The Sounding of the Whale</i> is big in terms of both size and importance. In his investigation of the creation of knowledge about whales, Burnett offers a uniquely fertile avenue into the fraught topics of modern whaling, science-based regulation, and the dramatic shift in the cultural meanings of whales during the twentieth century. The volume itself offers eloquent testimony to the centrality of historical narrative for understanding the relationship between science and regulation. Yet, despite the lesson that complexity and distinctiveness matter, deeply, for the particular case of twentieth-century whaling, Burnett&#x2019;s study also illuminates durable characteristics of science-based regulation and provides analytical context for current controversies such as the scientific whaling exception or the concept of 'scientific uncertainty.' Historians of various stripes, those who study science, the environment, politics, or culture, will find this invaluable study worthy of careful and considered attention, but so will environmental activists, political scientists, and people concerned with the history and fate of the largest creatures on our planet and their smaller marine mammalian brethren.&nbsp; To use little words to describe a big book, Burnett's <i>The Sounding of the Whale</i> is great."</p> (Helen Rozwadowski, author of Fathoming the Ocean)<br><br><p>"This wonderful book documents the interplays among science, conservation and politics in the evolving career of the whale over the last century, with bravura, insight and wit, as has never been done before.&nbsp;Using a narrative style, it explores the thoughts and trials of the men behind the origins and activities of the Discovery Investigations, the International Whaling Commission and the save-the-whale movement.&nbsp;It's scholarly history that reads like a good novel--Harmer, Kellogg, Mackintosh, Lilly, and more; they're all here, in full. The language is marvelous: original and eloquent."</p> (William Perrin, Senior Scientist for Marine Mammals at the Southwest Fisheries Science Center, NOAA Fisheries Service)<br><br><p>"In the early twentieth century, whale biology was restricted to the flensing decks of factory ships, where scientists were in danger of being sucked 'into the belly of the beast' of modern whaling. Graham Burnett artfully renders the history, and the often fractious relationship, between biologists and whalers; I felt as if I had discovered a trail of ambergris meticulously arrayed along the shores of twentieth-century cetology. <i>The Sounding of the Whale</i> is a work of stunning scholarship and a bracing read."</p> (Joe Roman, author of Listed and Whale)<br><br>"By questioning the very nature of our scientific interest in the whale,&nbsp;Burnett has set the tone for a new century of discovery&#x2014;and, one hopes, recovery. . . . A&nbsp;history of breathtaking depth." (<i>Nature</i>)<br><br><p>"In other hands it might have yielded a story as dry as dust, but this historian has an eye for small, telling details, resulting in an intriguing book full of paradoxes and unlikely heroes."</p> (Tim Flannery <i>New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br><p>"The heft of <i>The Sounding of the Whale</i> does not weigh it down, not least because Burnett takes the reader on some wonderfully strange detours.

He explores the gods and divinatory arts of the legendary Sumerians and the star-wise Babylonians, including the birth of astrology. He examines the afterlife beliefs of the ancient Egyptians and the dream interpretation practices and oracles of ancient Greece, including the mysteries of Eleusis and the magical philosophy of Plato, Socrates, and other Greeks. He uncovers the origins of Gnosticism and the suppression and banishment of magic by the post-pagan, Christian emperors of Rome. <br><br>Seligmann reviews the principles of alchemy, sharing famous transmutations and allegorical illustrations of the alchemical process and explores the Hermetica and its remarkable adepts. Investigating the Middle Ages, the author discusses the work of European magicians of the time, including Albertus Magnus, Roger Bacon, Agrippa, Nostradamus, and Pico Della Mirandola. He studies the medieval practices of devil worship, witchcraft, and black magic, as well as the &#x201c;Cabala&#x201d; in both its Hebrew and Christian forms. He also examines the art of the Tarot and many lesser known divination techniques. He explores the development of secret societies, including Freemasonry and Rosicrucianism, in the 17th century and the increase in occult publications and magical science in the 18th century. <br><br>First published in 1948, this history of magic and the occult seeks to &#x201c;mirror&#x201d; the magical worldview throughout the ages. Beautifully illustrated with images from the author&#x2019;s rare library, this collector&#x2019;s edition features all of the artwork--more than 250 images--from the original 1948 edition.</p><p>Kurt Seligmann (1900-1962) was a Swiss-American Surrealist painter and expert on magic, known for his extensive collection of rare books and his monumental role in the popularization of Surrealism in the United States. After the outbreak of World War II in 1939, he was the first European Surrealist to arrive in New York. After the war his work was exhibited widely and acquired by museums throughout the United States and Europe. He taught for many years at various colleges in New York City.<b>ALCHEMY <br></b><br>Origins of Alchemy <br><br>There is evidence that the art which was later called alchemy came to the West at the beginning of the second century of the Christian Era. The most important testimony substantiating this is that of Pliny the Elder (A.D. 23-79) who writes extensively on metallurgy but does not mention ideas which could be included among those related to alchemy. The various beliefs concerning metals and their treatment mentioned by Pliny indicate that alchemy was in his time ready to emerge. <br><br>Despite the alchemists&#x2019; claim concerning the age of their art, it is in point of fact the youngest magical wisdom. The notion that it flourished during the time of the Pharaohs has been abandoned along with the etymology <i>chem</i> or <i>qem,</i> meaning black, an Egyptian word employed occasionally to describe Egypt, whose black soil contrasted so sharply with the red earth of the desert. <br><br>It was in the fourth century, amidst the merciless fight which Christianity was waging against paganism, that alchemy flowered. Zosimus of Panopolis, a writer of that epoch, appointed himself the apologist of the alchemical art. His allegories and comments are cited by mediaeval experts as the most profound and venerable documents of the arcana.<br><br>Zosimus declared that the knowledge of metals, precious stones, and scents dated back to the epoch mentioned furtively in the Genesis: &#x201c;The sons of God saw the daughters of men, that they were fair.&#x201d; The mysterious sons of God were believed to be fallen angels who had mated with the women of antediluvian times. <br><br>In gratitude, the angels taught these women various arts, obviously with the intention that their companions make jewels, colorful garments, and perfumes with which to adorn their beauty. Thus, the wise men of ancient times decided that the fallen angels must have been evil, perverters of morals and manners. <br><br>Tertullian (ca. A.D. 160-240) confirms these early beliefs, saying that the sons of God bequeathed their wisdom to the mortals with the evil intention of seducing them to &#x201c;mundane pleasures.&#x201d; <br><br>According to Zosimus, these happenings marked the beginning of alchemy. He was repeating what late Jewish and early Christian writers had already declared. Zosimus elaborates upon the subject and gives also the name of a very early master of the alchemical art, the mysterious Chemes, though this legendary ancestor of the gold-makers has left no evidence that he ever existed. However, it was accepted that Chemes had written a book which he called <i>Chema</i>, and that the fallen angels had given lessons to the daughters of men with the aid of this book. From Chemes and <i>Chema</i> was derived <i>Chemia</i>, a name which was given consequently to the art itself. <br><br>The Greek word <i>Chemia</i> was the designation for alchemy until the Arabs added to it the article <i>&#x2018;al&#x2019;</i> of their native tongue. <br><br>In an early alchemical manuscript, a priestess who calls herself Isis and who addresses her writings to her son Horus declares that she owed her knowledge to the first of the angels and prophets: Amnael. Isis does not hesitate to tell us that she acquired her wisdom as a reward for intercourse with Amnael. Her book is of great interest to the student of alchemical tradition, and still more revealing are the writings of a woman known by the pseudonym of Mary the Jewess. Mary, a Greek, is apparently the earliest alchemist of the West. None of her writings have survived in complete form, but she is cited by her colleagues, like Zosimus, as if she might be identified with Moses&#x2019; sister Miriam. She is a most capable chemist, and the invention of a series of new technical devices is ascribed to her: the vessel enclosed in a box of hot ashes, producing a low and steady heat; the dung bed which retains its warmth for an indefinite time; the double boiler, still called in French <i>bain-marie</i>. <br><br>Speaking of women alchemists, we must not forget the early scholar who called herself Cleopatra; and Theosebia, Zosimus&#x2019; sister. The participation of so many women in the study of the newly invented art is like a confirmation of the fable that wills the fair sex to be connected with the origins of alchemy. <br><br>The literature provides a clear picture of the early alchemical art. By these authentic writings it is possible to unwind the silky thread which fable has spun into a marvelous cocoon, and to unravel its mystery. <br><br>Together with magic and other illicit arts, alchemy was revealed to mankind by the cursed angels, betrayers of God&#x2019;s secrets. They had been punished for this indiscretion; a curse lay upon the forbidden knowledge which enabled man to rival his creator. Investigation of the hidden works of nature was sacrilegious. St. Augustine shares this conception when he censures &#x201c;the vain and curious desire of investigation, known as knowledge and science.&#x201d; <br><br>The rivalry between knowledge and faith had likewise been perceived by Roman writers. In his book <i>On the Nature of Things</i>, Lucretius (ca. 98-53 B.C.) exclaims triumphantly: &#x201c;Thus is religion trod down, by a just reverse; victory makes us akin to the gods.&#x201d; He adds, hypocritically: &#x201c;Do not think that I wish to teach you the principles of impiety, or to lead you to the path of crime.&#x201d; <br><br>Throughout the first centuries of our era, the tree of knowledge of the Genesis remained the symbol of such sinful investigation. With the eating of the forbidden fruit, man had become like God, knowing good and evil. No doubt the alchemists accepted such views, yet they proceeded with their investigations just the same. Isis&#x2019; boast sounds like a challenge to the passage of Genesis. Gnostic teachings created this entirely new attitude, for many Gnostic sects were indifferent to the problem of good and evil. The Ophites worshipped the serpent of the bible as a beneficent being, since it had rightly directed man to knowledge. The tree of knowledge and the serpent were thus to become the most cherished emblems of alchemy.</p><h2>ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIOLOGY 3ED:FROM ANALYSI: From Analysis To Action</h2><p>Environmental Sociology encourages students to use the sociological imagination to explore a broad spectrum of issues facing the environment today.

(Amy Lubitow, Portland State University)<br><br>This reader, a collection of almost two dozen essays, surveys issues and presents contemporary research in environmental sociology. The essays ask crucial questions about how social forces affect how we see, understand, and ultimately engage nature. To this end, they connect issues like toxic waste or the limits of green economics to racism, food justice, sexism, and class. Their social context is the United States. The essays are organized into eight sections that open with an exploration of the concept of nature. The following sections consider how political economy structures environmental crises and solutions, how social inequalities produce environmental harm, emotions and identity in the social construction of our environments, disasters and industrial society, globalization, science as the producer of both risk and knowledge, and finally ideas for ecologically sensitive social action. The contributors, including luminaries like John Bellamy Foster and Alison Hope Alkon, are mostly sociologists working in universities.

An associate clinical professor at the National College of Naturopathic Medicine, Dr. Stengler is in private practice in La Jolla, California.</p>Balch, who coauthored the bestselling <i>Prescription for Nutritional Healing</i>, and Stengler, a naturopathic doctor, present this hefty reference book with detailed entries for about 200 ailments, from "abscess" to "warts." Each entry offers a definition of the condition and an explanation of associated symptoms, causes and testing techniques. The authors provide treatment options for each problem, including homeopathy, hydrotherapy and "Super Seven Prescriptions" (specific remedies mostly involving dietary supplements). Although some readers may wonder why almost as many pages are devoted to "dizziness" as "cancer," the entries do provide a helpful overview of common therapeutic approaches and include journal references, though it appears only some of the recommendations are supported by published studies. Balch and Stengler review basic alternative therapies, too, such as diet and nutrition, nutritional supplements and traditional Chinese medicine. While they acknowledge that some people will require both conventional and natural treatment, their tendency to equate "natural" with "nontoxic" seems overly simplistic. Many dietary supplements, for example, can be as potent as prescription drugs and cause side effects or interact with other medications. Still, readers navigating the sprawling world of alternative medicine will find this comprehensive resource to be a helpful starting place. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

(CW 10)</h2><p><b>Rudolf Steiner Press has published a new series of re-edited, re-typeset, and re-designed editions of the classic, authorized translations of Rudolf Steiner's foundational books. Each volume of this series is printed in a limited edition of 1,000 copies and sewn-bound in high-quality cloth, finished with colored end papers, and includes a book-mark ribbon.</b><br><br>Steiner's foundational handbook for spiritual and personal development has grown more modern with time, though his methods remain clearly distinguishable from many current paths of inner work. First, Steiner's method is based on the clarity of thought normally associated with scientific research. Instead of denying clear thinking, his aim is to extend it beyond its present limitations. Second, Steiner recognizes&#x2015;as do all genuine paths&#x2015;that the way to spiritual experience is arduous and dangerous and calls for self-control in thought, word, and action. The human being comprises a unity, and we cannot develop knowledge without a corresponding development of feeling and will. <br><br>Steiner predicted that humanity would begin to experience a longing for forms of experience that transcended intellectual, materialistic thinking. More than a hundred years after the first publication of this book, countless means are offered for achieving transcendental experience, including Eastern meditation practices, channeling, remote viewing, and astral projection. Moreover, there has been a huge increase in the number of people who report various suprasensory perceptions, such as near-death experiences and meetings with angels. In this context, Steiner's key spiritual guidebook is needed more than ever, given its unique, precise instructions for inner training, its protective exercises, and its indications for staying grounded and centered. <i><b>Knowledge of the Higher Worlds</b></i> begins with the preconditions for personal development and guides the reader through the stages of initiation, its practical aspects, and its effects.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world.

Living in the first part of the eighteenth century in Podolia and Wolhynia, the Baal-Shem braved scorn and rejection from the rabbinical establishment and attracted followers from among the common people, the poor, and the mystically inclined. Here Buber offers a sensitive and intuitive account of Hasidism, followed by twenty stories about the life of the Baal-Shem. This book is the earliest and one of the most delightful of Buber&#39;s seven volumes on Hasidism and can be read not only as a collection of myth but as a key to understanding the central theme of Buber&#39;s thought: the I-Thou, or dialogical, relationship.&#34;All positive religion rests on an enormous simplification of the manifold and wildly engulfing forces that invade us: it is the subduing of the fullness of existence.

Marlowe&#39;s entanglement with the Sternwood family - and an attendant cast of colorful underworld figures - is the background to a story reflecting all the tarnished glitter of the great American Dream. The detective&#39;s iconic image burns just as brightly in &#34;Farewell My Lovely&#34;, on the trail of a missing nightclub crooner. And the inimitable Marlowe is able to prove that trouble really is his business in Raymond Chandler&#39;s brilliant epitaph, &#34;The Long Goodbye&#34;.</p><p>Raymond Thornton Chandler was born in Chicago in 1888, but moved to England with his family when he was twelve, where he attended Dulwich College, alma mater to some of the twentieth century&#39;s most renowned writers. Returning to America in 1912, he settled in California, worked in a number of jobs, and later married. It was during the Depression era that he seriously turned his hand to writing, and his first published story appeared in the pulp magazine Black Mask in 1933, followed six years later, when he was fifty, by his first novel, The Big Sleep. Chandler died in 1959, having established himself as the finest crime writer in America.</p><h2>International Energy Markets: Understanding Pricing, Policies, and Profits</h2><p>Industry leader, Carol Dahl has thoroughly revised and updated her classic text <i>International Energy Markets: Understanding Pricing, Policies, and Profits</i>.

How does it prepare a young man or woman for combat? At West Point, Elizabeth Samet reads classic and modern works of literature with America's future military elite, and in this stirring memoir she chronicles the ways in which war has transformed her relationship to the books she and her students read together. While fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan, Samet's former students share their thoughts on the poetry of Wallace Stevens, the fiction of Virginia Woolf and J. M. Coetzee, the epics of Homer, and the films of Bogart and Cagney. And their letters in turn prompt Samet to wonder exactly what she owes to cadets in the classroom. <i>Soldier's Heart</i> is an honest and original reflection on the relationship between art and life.</p></p><p><p><b>Elizabeth D.

I was so startled when it crackled to life I nearly dropped it:<br>SHAKESPEARE 3, THIS IS SHAKESPEARE 6&#x2014;OVERSHAKESPEARE 6, THIS IS SHAKESPEARE 3&#x2014;OVERSHAKESPEARE 3, GIVE ME A SITREP WHEN YOU HAVE THE ENEMY IN SIGHT&#x2014;OVERWILCO&#x2014;OUT<br>I have said out when I should have said over. I have taken far too long to figure out that SITREP means situation report. Somewhere this might be fatal. Here the amused voice on the other end, that of my colleague Dan, grumbles that I&#x2019;m not allowed to end a transmission I didn&#x2019;t start:<br>YOU CAN&#x2019;T SAY OUT, SHAKESPEARE 3, ONLY I CAN SAY OUTOOPS<br>I had volunteered for this mission: standing guard at the doors of the United States Military Academy&#x2019;s Department of English, during the school&#x2019;s annual Plebe Parent Weekend, which is immediately abbreviated&#x2014;as all things military must be&#x2014;PPW. This event is designed to gratify the curiosity of parents who have only recently surrendered their children to the United States Corps of Cadets, West Point&#x2019;s student body. In their first semester, plebes take English 101, an introductory composition course that is part of the Academy&#x2019;s thirty-course core curriculum, which includes everything from engineering to philosophy, military history to information technology, economics to psychology. The plebes dwell at the bottom of a four-class hierarchy in which sophomores, juniors, and seniors go by the names yearlings, cows, and firsties respectively. All of this terminology takes some getting used to. Even when you think you know what things are, you can&#x2019;t be sure you know what to call them.<br>It had been decided that every department needed a presence at the door of its open house. To lend myself the aura of officialdom, I retrieved from the bottom of my desk drawer a name tag I hadn&#x2019;t worn since new faculty orientation several years before. Identifying me as prof samet, dept of english, it was emblazoned with the belligerent Academy crest of Pallas Athena and the microscopic words civilian service, a designation that turns out to be a statement of the obvious: if you aren&#x2019;t in uniform&#x2014;even in civilian clothes most cadets and officers give themselves away by their bearing, their haircuts, and their fashion choices&#x2014;it is pretty clear what you are. And while a few tourists have mistaken me for a cadet over the years, the cadets themselves have never been confused.<br>There are civilian professors at all of the service academies (Army, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard), as well as on the faculties of the military&#x2019;s various staff and senior service colleges. At the Military Academy, civilian professors are considered emergency personnel; we acquire the magnificently redundant epithet key and essential. In weather-related emergencies, when West Point, which like other Army installations is referred to as a post, goes to a condition called Code Red, some civilian employees can stay home, but as the memo issued at the start of each academic year explains, I need to make arrangements for an emergency billet with someone on post in the event that nature threatens to derail my commute. The strategic advantages of the terrain that made this location attractive in the eighteenth century, when Fort Putnam was built high up on the west bank of the Hudson River, make the approach on winter days rather daunting. Civilians who live off post, and most do, must venture over one of the surrounding mountains. Should a dangling modifier need reattaching, a sentence fragment suturing, or a metaphor anatomizing in a storm, however, I will be first on the scene. That&#x2019;s a set of priorities an English professor can embrace.<br>The mothers and fathers I greeted at the door during that Plebe Parent Weekend knew none of this trivia. To them, I was simply a nuisance, a guard at a border checkpoint who stood between them and news of their children. Briefed on my duties, I took up my post armed with half of a two-way radio set issued to me with mock solemnity by the head of the department, a position always occupied by a colonel, who had borrowed it from his grandchildren for the occasion. There I waited for the mothers and fathers of the plebes to invade our open house in search of their sons&#x2019; or daughters&#x2019; professors. I had orders to bar the suspicious, to interrogate all those unaccompanied by a cadet, and to send the rest upstairs.<br>Why all the fuss? Because it was October 2001, and everything, as it quickly became fashionable to say, had changed. Once an open post with a friendly MP who waved visitors through the gates, West Point, like military installations everywhere, had responded to the events of September 11 by instituting a variety of force-protection measures. Unsettled as I initially was by the idea of being greeted each morning by a soldier with an M-16, I knew I would get used even to that. Before September 11, life at West Point had been&#x2014;there&#x2019;s no other word for it&#x2014;peaceful. When I arrived, in the summer of 1997, the Army to which the school contributes about a thousand second lieutenants each spring wasn&#x2019;t at war with anyone. Firsties knew that they could look forward to a series of stateside assignments and a tour in Germany or Korea, but they couldn&#x2019;t really count on combat unless perhaps they joined the Special Forces, and then they wouldn&#x2019;t be able to tell anyone about it anyway. In 1999, I attended a belated but symbolically significant ceremony at which officers were awarded Recognition Certificates for their faithful service during the Cold War era (September 2, 1945&#x2013;<br>December 26, 1991). Even the Russians weren&#x2019;t there to kick around anymore. The most heated debates of the day centered on whether it was appropriate for the Army, and for the country, to engage in peacekeeping and humanitarian-aid missions. These debates haven&#x2019;t been resolved, only eclipsed.<br>As I processed the parents, one of my colleagues&#x2014;usually Dan, who was rather amused by all of this&#x2014;would check in periodically. Dan had served for several years with the Army&#x2019;s prestigious 82nd Airborne Division before earning his Ph.D. in philosophy. There are three main constituencies on the West Point faculty: civilian Ph.D.s (20 percent); a rotating military component of captains and majors who earn a master&#x2019;s degree, serve for three years, and then return to the field Army (60 percent); and a senior military contingent of lieutenant colonels and colonels who have gone back to graduate school for the Ph.D. (20 percent). Dan had done a three-year tour at West Point earlier in his career, but I met him when he returned as a member of the senior military faculty. He is from Montana, and its wide-open spaces have shaped his attitudes toward people and society. He is a man of the west who has spirit, rough humor, and generosity; a cowboy who happens also to have read an enormous amount of Kant. Dan&#x2019;s speech is a wonderfully improbable amalgamation of the scatological and the academic. He wrestles with philosophical theories as if they are calves to be roped or deer to be butchered.<br>After he took me deer hunting one winter morning, I took to calling Dan Elmer Fudd. We had gone out to the woods with the aim of knocking something over, but our crunching footsteps in the overnight snowfall made us about as stealthy as cartoon killers: Be vewy quiet. I&#x2019;m hunting wabbits. I felt slightly ridiculous (and very cold) tromping around in the snow with my bright orange safety vest and hat. Dan, by contrast, is utterly at home in the woods stalking his prey, alert and light on his feet. Of only medium height, he&#x2019;s got the athletic build and movements of a former wrestler and the soldier&#x2019;s no-nonsense, close-cropped haircut. Put all that together with a knowledge of his physical competitiveness and incredible capacity for pain&#x2014;something I learned when he almost sliced his thumb off but refused at first to go to the hospital&#x2014;and you behold a fairly intimidating figure in camouflage. At the end of the day, I fired a few rounds from Dan&#x2019;s .270 rifle, which has a kick so strong that it almost knocked me over. I also had a ringing in my ears for a day, and I suddenly understood why so many of my military friends have suffered serious hearing loss. Like many officers, Dan has especial patience when it comes to training novices, and even the most incurable city mouse can emerge from a day in the woods under his tutelage with a richer understanding of nature, wildlife, and firearms.<br>On the day of the open house, Shakespeare call signs seemed appropriate:<br>SHAKESPEARE 3, THIS IS SHAKESPEARE 6, HAVE YOU SECURED THE PERIMETER?&#x2014;OVERSHAKESPEARE 3, THIS IS SHAKESPEARE 6, DO YOU NEED RELIEF AT YOUR POST?&#x2014;OVERNEGATIVE&#x2014;OVERROGER&#x2014;OUT<br>Relief? No way. Refusing to surrender my post, I processed legions of parents with dispatch. In they pressed, fathers carrying video cameras, mothers wearing black parkas with gold letters indicating their children&#x2019;s class, usma 05. These parkas are standard issue for cadets, who often buy extra ones for their mothers, girlfriends, and, occasionally, fathers.<br>In the gray days of winter, when the castellated stone buildings blend with the sky and the wind rips off the Hudson, these parkas and the winter caps that go with them are the emblems of shared misery. There is a profound sense in which an eighteen-year-old plebe needs to feel that he has suffered, and suffered cruelly. Reporting to West Point sometimes only days after high school graduation, the new cadet spends the summer trudging through the humid woods of the Hudson Valley in face paint and camouflage imagining her friends sleeping late or going to the beach. In the fall, when he has exchanged his Army combat uniform (ACU) for a more businesslike as-for-class uniform and plunged into a heavy load of required courses, the shorn plebe&#x2019;s friends instant-message him with tales of growing beards, rushing fraternities, and signing up for (but not necessarily attending) whatever classes strike their fancy.

Freelance writer Mahl has convincingly drawn on a variety of sources--including recently declassified FBI and government files, memoirs, personal papers, and little-known official reports--to weave together a portrait of extraordinary schemes and activities. He argues that such conventional sources as the official British history of the war are misleading and inadequate. Britain, lacking the resources to fight Nazi Germany alone, needed the immense production capacities and vast manpower of the US to save itself. But the British government was deeply concerned about American intentions: The nation seemed both unpredictable and unreliable in its support of Britain. To gain American allegiance, Britain launched a sizable propaganda campaign and a number of intelligence actions, many carried out or managed by William Stevenson (``Intrepid''), Britain's spy extraordinaire. Mahl asserts that British agents had willing accomplices in FDR's White House, filled with an anglophile elite that identified deeply with Britain. His research reveals that foreign money was poured into some congressional elections to defeat isolationist politicians, that British agents spent money freely to ease the passage of the Lend- Lease Act, that they planted pro-British articles in interventionist newspapers and magazines, and that some national opinion polls were rigged to reflect a deeper and stronger pro- British sentiment than existed. British agents set up Bill Donovan's Office of Stragetic Services and helped run it, and they established or influenced a number of organizations pushing for American intervention. Their efforts were ingenious and effective. They were also either dubious or downright illegal, but Mahl argues that, given the desperate situation in Europe, Britain had little choice.

Can a child's contact with cat litter lead to schizophrenia? In her eye-opening new book, National Book Critics Circle Award-winning author Harriet Washington reveals that we can in fact "catch" mental illness. In INFECTIOUS MADNESS, Washington presents the new germ theory, which posits not only that many instances of Alzheimer's, OCD, and schizophrenia are caused by viruses, prions, and bacteria, but also that with antibiotics, vaccinations, and other strategies, these cases can be easily prevented or treated. Packed with cutting-edge research and tantalizing mysteries, INFECTIOUS MADNESS is rich in science, characters, and practical advice on how to protect yourself and your children from exposure to infectious threats that could sabotage your mental and physical health.</p><p>Harriet A.

Most often, this drama focuses on whites who turned west to conquer a continent, extending "liberty" as they went. Great Crossings also includes Native Americans from across the continent seeking new ways to assert anciently-held rights and people of African descent who challenged the United States to live up to its ideals. These diverse groups met in an experimental community in central Kentucky called Great Crossings, home to the first federal Indian school and a famous interracial family. <br><br>Great Crossings embodied monumental changes then transforming North America. The United States, within the span of a few decades, grew from an East Coast nation to a continental empire. The territorial growth of the United States forged a multicultural, multiracial society, but that diversity also sparked fierce debates over race, citizenship, and America's destiny. Great Crossings, a place of race-mixing and cultural exchange, emerged as a battleground. Its history provides an intimate view of the ambitions and struggles of Indians, settlers, and slaves who were trying to secure their place in a changing world. Through deep research and compelling prose, Snyder introduces us to a diverse range of historical actors: Richard Mentor Johnson, the politician who reportedly killed Tecumseh and then became schoolmaster to the sons of his former foes; Julia Chinn, Johnson's enslaved concubine, who fought for her children's freedom; and Peter Pitchlynn, a Choctaw intellectual who, even in the darkest days of Indian removal, argued for the future of Indian nations. Together, their stories demonstrate how this era transformed colonizers and the colonized alike, sowing the seeds of modern America.<br></p><p><br><strong>Christina Snyder</strong> is McCabe Greer Professor of History at Pennsylvania State University. She is the author of the award-winning <em>Slavery in Indian Country: The Changing Face of Captivity in Early America.</em><br><br>"<em>Great Crossings</em> warrants attention from a wide multidisciplinary readership. From the short-lived experiment at Choctaw Academy, Snyder offers new insight into race, class, slavery, education, and other aspects of antebellum American society. She even shares a foreshadowing glimpse into what would become the United States' Indian boarding-school system later in the century. This book, moreover, contributes plenty to our understanding of how integral and intricate Indigenous experiences have been throughout American history." -- Daniel Usner, <em>Native American and Indigenous Studies</em><p></p><br>"In <em>Great Crossings</em>, Christina Snyder tells a compelling story with a diverse cast of vivid characters. At a Kentucky school for Indians run by a white visionary with an enslaved common-law wife, Snyder finds a more inclusive, revealing, and hopeful vision of the America we call Jacksonian. Written with clarity and verve, <em>Great Crossings</em> is the work of a great historian." - Alan Taylor, author of <em>American Revolutions: A Continental History, 1750-1804</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Great Crossings</em> is a rare gem, a story that confounds assumptions about the American past. This is nuanced, personal, heartbreaking history with surprises at every turn. It will change the way we teach about Jacksonian America." - Elizabeth A. Fenn, author of <em>Encounters at the Heart of the World:</em> <em>A History of the Mandan People</em><p></p><br>"<em>Great Crossings</em> is a beautifully told story that offers us an intimate and engaging perspective on the large-scale forces and pressures shaping the United States between the Revolution and the Civil War. Snyder succeeds in bringing her readers into the Choctaw Academy and the lives of the diverse and fascinating individuals who lived there. The school transformed how all involved viewed the United States, its past, and its future. Snyder's wonderful book will do the same for readers." - Joshua Piker, <em>Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture</em><p></p><br>"From the opening scene of Choctaw children reciting Cicero at a barbeque overseen by war hero politician Richard Mentor Johnson and his enslaved common law wife Julia Chinn, this book will change how you see nineteenth-century America. Deeply researched and vividly told, Christina Snyder's book shows how various Native, black, and white Americans came together at Great Crossings in a realistic attempt to create a multicultural life for themselves and future generations, as the rest of United States moved in the opposite direction." - Kathleen DuVal, author of <em>Independence Lost: Lives on</em> <em>the Edge of the American Revolution</em> <br><p></p><br>"In <em>Great Crossings</em>, Christina Snyder vividly brings to life a moment when Blacks, whites, and Natives came together in a fragile experiment designed to chart a new destiny for North America and its diverse peoples. The story of the extraordinary Choctaw Academy reveals in poignant detail the paths not taken as the United States transformed itself from a struggling new nation to a continental empire." - Karl Jacoby, author of <em>The Strange Career of William Ellis: The Texas Slave Who Became a Mexican Millionaire</em><p></p><br>"What Snyder has found in the story of a modest school is the perfect confluence of the ethnic cleansing of Native America, the absolute manacling of black America, and the consequent creation of white America's modern United States. This historiographically rich, meticulously researched, and accessibly written book makes an important contribution. Yet <em>Great Crossings</em> also attests to the triumph of the racial thinking whose rise it narrates and subjects to such intricate criticism." --James Taylor Carson, <em>Journal of American History</em> <br><p></p><br>"Some stories are too incredible not to be true. The tale of Richard Mentor Johnson and his Choctaw Academy would tax the imagination of a novelist. The Indian academy becomes a triracial mixing ground and finally a cauldron, where all of Jacksonian America's complexities and contradictions of race, class, and gender play out in public view. The story is true, and Christina Snyder's <em>Great Crossings</em> tells it exquisitely. Snyder relates this fascinating tale with sensitivity and insight, in a narrative alive with personality and vignette. She wisely resists the temptation to typecast heroes and villains, or to frame the story in simple declensionist terms." --Daniel Feller, H-AmIndian, H-Net Reviews <br><p></p><br>"Christina Snyder's <em>Great CrossingsiR enhances the historiography of the Native South by opening a window into a fascinating world where Indian, white, and black social intimacies took shape, sometimes freely and productively, sometimes violently and with terrible consequences, especially for the</em> <em>enslaved.

The nature of the self, the value of relationships, the importance of moment-to-moment awareness, the destructiveness of anger, the suffering that attends attachment, the ambiguity of the earth&#x2019;s beauty, the inevitability of aging, the certainty of death&#x2013;these dilemmas preoccupy us today as they did centuries ago.

But in his youth he had to make his way through a harsh colonial world, where he fought many battles with his rivals, but also with his wayward emotions. Taking Franklin to the age of forty-one, when he made his first electrical discoveries, Bunker goes behind the legend to reveal the sources of his passion for knowledge. Always trying to balance virtue against ambition, Franklin emerges as a brilliant but flawed human being, made from the conflicts of an age of slavery as well as reason. With archival material from both sides of the Atlantic, we see Franklin in Boston, London, and Philadelphia as he develops his formula for greatness. A tale of science, politics, war, and religion, this is also a story about Franklin's forebears: the talented family of English craftsmen who produced America's favorite genius.</p><p>NICK BUNKER is the author of <i>Making Haste from Babylon: The Mayflower Pilgrims and Their World</i> and <i>An Empire on the Edge: How Britain Came to Fight America</i>, the latter of which won the 2015 George Washington Prize.

With his long hair, his paunch, and his spectacles, he delighted his hosts in France with a manner that conveyed serenity as well as charm. Some of us can do gravitas, and some of us can do joie de vivre, but the Franklin of 1780 could do both. It was a rare combination, and all the more exceptional because it seemed to come so easily.<br><br> As America&#x2019;s envoy to the court of Versailles, Franklin could hush the chatter in a salon merely by pausing for a long while before he replied to a question. An oracle at peace with himself, or so it seemed, Franklin was always friendly and polite but also rather distant and reserved. Here was a sage who could be funny when he chose, but somehow never lose his aura of gentility.<br><br> Partly the secret lay in his build, stricken though he was by arthritis and the gout. In his prime, Franklin had been broad-shouldered and muscular, an inch or two under six feet tall. Even now at seventy, lean�ing on a cane, he struck one French observer as &#x201c;a very big man with an excellent figure.&#x201d; Although Franklin would lounge for hours over break�fast, reading the news from the war with the British, the long legs that stretched out across the floor were still firm and shapely: &#x201c;a very hand�some leg,&#x201d; one visitor recalled.<br><br> Besides the long pauses, which made the big American seem so august and sublime, Franklin had another way to be inscrutable. Unlike most public men of advancing years, he rarely bored his listeners with tales of past achievements, and least of all did he speak about his boyhood and his youth. This was true of his correspondence as well as his conversa�tion. When we turn to his letters, surviving in the thousands, we meet a Franklin who took the utmost pride in his grammar, his spelling, and the rhythm of his prose, but we will mostly search in vain for intimate details of his early years. Instead they show us a practical, up-to-date Franklin, for whom history&#x2014;including his own&#x2014;always seemed to matter far less than the future.<br><br> And so besides the dignity and the gravitas, Franklin also had a touch of mystery. By saying so little about his past, he maintained his aura of reserve, and he did it so well that it has endured until the present day. After a lifetime&#x2019;s study of the man, scholars sometimes come away feel�ing that Franklin will always slip through our fingers. &#x201c;He kept a kind of inner core of himself intact and unapproachable,&#x201d; wrote Edmund Morgan, the historian from Yale, in one of the finest books about him. In Franklin&#x2019;s own era, those who tried to grapple with the sage often found him even more elusive. Whether they loved or hated Dr. Franklin, they could simply never pin him down.<br><br> Where had he come from? That they knew&#x2014;first Boston, and then Philadelphia&#x2014;but it was hardly much to go on. What were his origins? Who were his family? How had he become the genius he was? Today when we look for answers to these questions we simply open his autobi�ography, written in fits and starts over the space of twenty years. There we find a very different Franklin, a man who loved to delve into his roots; but in his lifetime he chose to keep the book from the public eye. Not until 1791, the year after his death, did the first edition of his memoirs appear in print. Even then it was only a French translation and it was incomplete.<br><br> As far as the outside world was concerned, his career had begun with a flash and a bang in 1751, when&#x2014;at the age of forty-five&#x2014;he pub�lished the first edition of his scientific papers, <i>Experiments and Observations on Electricity, </i>with his startling theory that electricity and lightning were identical. After that Franklin was rarely out of the news, as he played his many parts as scientist, politician, ambassador, and rebel. His earlier life was something else entirely: provincial, obscure, and all but impossible to reach. <br><br> In the Philadelphia of the Revolution, there were aging citizens who remembered Franklin the printer, bent over the proofs of <i>The Pennsylvania Gazette, </i>but that was a very long time ago and the details were hard to recover. Three decades had gone by since he ceased to be the paper&#x2019;s edi�tor. Although everyone knew Franklin as the author of <i>The Way to Wealth, </i>with its maxims and its jokes culled from his annual, <i>Poor Richard&#x2019;s Alma�nack, </i>even that was something whose origins were lost from view. In its heyday in the 1740s, the almanac had a circulation of ten thousand, but it was a product people kept for a few years and then discarded: how could they know that one day the author would be famous? As for his early journalism, written when he was a teenager in Boston, it had been forgot�ten long ago. Bylines had yet to be invented, and so his youthful columns disappeared into the archives, dusty and anonymous, to be rediscovered only in the nineteenth century.<br><br> With his memoirs still hidden away so discreetly, Franklin&#x2019;s public image was very different from the picture we now have of him. For us he will always be the teenage runaway made good, a whimsical fellow with his gadgets and his jokes. In his lifetime, when they encountered the elderly Franklin what most people saw was a mountain of a man, whose sense of humor took a distant second place to his weighty achievements in science and public affairs. It was as if they had beheld another Moses: a prophet from Sinai, bearing his tablets of stone, wrapped in a cloud that concealed the sources of his energy.<br><br> ***<br> &nbsp;<br> From time to time, however, Franklin would meet a shrewd observer who could see behind the mask of serenity. Among the many portraits that survive, perhaps the best is the marble bust made in Paris in 1779 by a French sculptor, Jean-Antoine Houdon, whose powers of insight were superb. With that unflinching realism for which the French are famous, he shows us a hero with a hinterland: a patriarch whose wisdom is the product of hard labor.<br><br> At first sight the bust gives us a classical figure, a philosopher king of the kind that Plato hoped to see ruling his ideal city. The dignity is there and so is the reserve. In the firmness of his gaze, we see the Franklin who had been an athlete in his youth: an excellent swimmer and a fine boxer who knew how to fell an opponent with an upper cut to the jaw. But if we walk around the bust, and peer at it closely, the image becomes as subtle and complex as the man it sought to portray.<br><br> Houdon did not mean to flatter or to be a toady. Instead the artist gives us what he found before his eyes: an old man with a sagging chin. The long hair is an old man&#x2019;s hair, falling over Franklin&#x2019;s collar like a clump of dry seaweed on a rock. Although his jowls are heavy with flesh, in places the cheeks have sunk into hollows to reveal the skull beneath, as if to signify the imminence of death. Most skillfully of all, Houdon has shown the mouth tightly set, with pursed lips and a sense of strain. Perhaps the oracle is deep in thought; or perhaps he is trying to suppress a fit of anger.<br><br> While Franklin hoped to be seen as the affable sage, a hero who bore his grandeur with ease, the artist gives us someone else entirely: a Frank�lin who has achieved his gravitas only by way of a long campaign for self-control. More than a hundred years later, another French sculptor, Auguste Rodin, hailed the bust as a masterpiece in which Houdon cap�tured aspects of Franklin that the sage preferred to conceal. In what he called Franklin&#x2019;s &#x201c;long apostolic hair,&#x201d; Rodin found the homespun wis�dom of Poor Richard; in the &#x201c;large, obstinate forehead,&#x201d; the sculptor had shown courage and self-reliance, but in the eyes, the mouth, and the sheer bulk of Franklin&#x2019;s mighty head, Rodin also saw &#x201c;the hard common-sense of the calculator.&#x201d; With his jowls and his furrowed brow, this is the Franklin who had been a tradesman.<br><br> In a century when to count as a dignitary you were supposed to be born to grandeur, and to show no signs of strain, Franklin was an odd�ity: a man who had risen to fame after an early career filled with the daily grind of business. The successes of his life required long years of effort: with his science, with his books or in the printing shop, always on a deadline, where the work was exhausting and repetitive and subject to the foibles of the market. Many printers went bankrupt, and most of those whom Franklin knew died young. For businesspeople in the 1700s, an age without a safety net, life could be more precarious than we can readily imagine. A storm in the Atlantic, a crisis in the markets in Lon�don, a war in the West Indies, or a failed harvest of tobacco&#x2014;any one of these could spell commercial disaster. If you were in business in colonial America, calamity lay just around the corner. <br><br> In the bust that Houdon made, we see a survivor of adversity who always knew how close he had come to failure. In his years of stardom, when people told him what a genius he was, Franklin would enjoy the compliments but remain aloof: partly because he had diplomacy to do, but also because he knew that his career might easily have ended in oblivion. Time and again in his early life Franklin had seen the sorry fate of other young men, his friends or his rivals, who had fallen by the wayside, victims of smallpox, alcohol, or promiscuity: or simply destroyed by bad luck when the market turned against them.<br><br> Why had he gone on to be a success, while so many others dropped down into ruin? This became the central theme of Franklin&#x2019;s memoirs, but he did not wish to have it explored by his readers until he was safely in the grave. Witty he might be, but Franklin was also a deeply serious man, conscious of the task he had to fulfill in building a new American republic. It would not have been helpful to give his rivals or his enemies, and not only the British, too many clues to the secrets of his past. <br><br> In his youth he had made embarrassing mistakes. Franklin listed in his memoirs those he was willing to confess. His life had also contained long detours and delays, so that he had to wait far too long to find his true vocation as a scientist. In his century, a man or woman of forty was already far advanced in middle age, but not until Franklin was turning forty-one could he begin his sustained experiments with physics. <br><br> With his pioneering work with electricity, Franklin became the Amer-ican heir of Sir Isaac Newton, helping to engineer another scientific revolution, not quite as profound as Sir Isaac&#x2019;s but close enough and still immensely fruitful. In the process, Franklin gave birth to the systematic study of science in America, as a program of disciplined research by a team and not a mere hobby for clergymen or lawyers working alone in their spare time. But as Franklin also knew, the pursuit of science placed severe demands on its practitioners. <br><br> First he had to master the technical literature. Next he had to find the apparatus, or build it for himself; and then, as he made his observations, Franklin had to devise a new scientific language to make sense of what he saw. After four years of trial and error, and thousands of hours of concentrated thought, Franklin produced his masterpiece, his electrical essays: but how many people truly understood the scale of his achievement? <br><br> Only Franklin knew the obstacles that he had overcome, and they were not a subject for casual talk around the dinner table. Like a veteran who comes back from a war but does not wish to speak about it, because he fears that the civilians will never understand what combat means, he did not wish to dwell in conversation on the rigors of his early life. Another thing was this: Franklin also knew how old he was and that the world of his youth bore little likeness to the civilized America in which his fellow rebels had come to maturity.<br><br> George Washington, the Adamses, John Hancock, and the rest: they were all far younger. Whatever they had seen by way of wars and politics and hardship, they had never known the world he had experienced as a boy. When Franklin was born in 1706, the last of the Stuarts still occu�pied the throne of England, and the colonies were only a few generations old, often raw and uncouth, with traces of barbarism. In the Boston of his childhood, every day in the street he would see men still in the prime of life who had helped to hang the Salem witches. As for Philadelphia, in his youth it was not far away from being a frontier post. When Franklin first entered the city, at just seventeen, people could still remember a time when settlers lived in caves by the Delaware.<br><br> ***<br><br> If the world of Franklin&#x2019;s boyhood seems remote, the England that his family inhabited feels more like something lost forever in a mist. Fasci�nated though he was by his ancestry, Franklin gives us in his memoirs only a brief account of his father, Josiah, and the rest of his forebears. This would not pose a problem if the Franklins had been just another poor, downtrodden family from some quaint little hamlet where nothing much happened from year to year. If that were so, the tale of the English Franklins would tell us very little about the sources of Franklin&#x2019;s genius.<br><br> In fact, when we investigate his origins, we find that long before he was born the Franklins were already talented people on the move. Excel�lent craftsmen, and highly ambitious, they emerged from a part of rural England where, even in the seventeenth century, there were clusters of science and technology, and local people of learning with whom they came to be friends. There and in London, where they went to work, the Franklins laid the foundations for Benjamin&#x2019;s career in America. Reading books and hearing preachers, plying their trade and acquiring the skills they needed, as time went by the Franklins built a family endowment: not a trust fund consisting of cash or stocks and bonds but instead a repertoire of ideas and expertise. In 1683, when Josiah Franklin arrived in Boston, he was a refugee, political and religious, in search of asylum at a time of crisis in the mother country. With him on the boat, Josiah carried a cultural legacy that he would bequeath to his children: a legacy defined by the word &#x201c;ingenuity.&#x201d;<br><br> If Franklin had a favorite noun, it was this one, a term that conveyed in the eighteenth century a far richer meaning than it carries today. In one form or another, the words &#x201c;ingenious&#x201d; and &#x201c;ingenuity&#x201d; appear sev�enteen times in his memoirs, used by Franklin to describe his father, his uncles, and all the other people he respected. When Franklin spoke of ingenuity, he had in mind a quality of being with as many facets as he had himself.<br><br> It was a hybrid virtue, a blend of many different ingredients: intellect, of course, but also imagination and skills with the hand and with the eye as well as with the brain. Ingenuity required not only diligence and learn�ing but also an elem...</p><h2>The Founders&#39; Constitution, Volume 3</h2><p><p>Originally published by the University of Chicago Press to commemorate the bicentennial of the United States Constitution, <b><i>The Founders&#x2019; Constitution</i></b> is arguably the most important of all resources on the principles of the Framers of the American republic.

Childhood abuse has many forms, but the message is always the same: people who love you hurt you. If you are the spouse or partner of a survivor of an abusive childhood, you know what that means-a relationship that has you worried, angry, or frustrated. You may be wondering if the person you love will ever "get over" his or her past, and if you can ever have a "normal" relationship. You may even have thought about leaving out of frustration and despair. But there is real help. Therapist Eliana Gil understands the special problems you and your partner face. Based on her extensive clinical experience with adults abused as children, she has developed a unique, much-needed program specifically for couples.

Their encounters rank among the most effective agents of change in all of world history, fostering the spread of technologies, ideas, beliefs, values and religions. This innovative study examines processes of cross-cultural encounter before 1492. It concentrates on several eras, from the age of the ancient silk roads that linked China with the Roman Empire, through the Mongol Empire, up until the early transoceanic ventures of Europeans during the fifteenth century. Taking a global rather than a Eurocentric or some other partial approach, the author examines in contact with each other, and he identifies distinctive patterns of conversion, conflict, and compromise that emerged from cross-cultural encounters. In doing so, he elucidates the larger historical context of encounters between Europeans and other peoples in modern times.</p><p>The author examines the dynamics that brought populations in contact with each other, and he identifies distinctive patterns of conversion, conflict, and compromise that emerged from crosscultural encounters.Jerry H.

The rise of the Internet and the wide availability of inexpensive computers have made it possible to gather and analyze network data on a large scale, and the development of a variety of new theoretical tools has allowed us to extract new knowledge from many different kinds of networks.<br><br>The study of networks is broadly interdisciplinary and important developments have occurred in many fields, including mathematics, physics, computer and information sciences, biology, and the social sciences. This book brings together for the first time the most important breakthroughs in each of these fields and presents them in a coherent fashion, highlighting the strong interconnections between work in different areas.<br> <br> Subjects covered include the measurement and structure of networks in many branches of science, methods for analyzing network data, including methods developed in physics, statistics, and sociology, the fundamentals of graph theory, computer algorithms, and spectral methods, mathematical models of networks, including random graph models and generative models, and theories of dynamical processes taking place on networks.<br><br>To request a copy of the Solutions Manual, visit: http://global.oup.com/uk/academic/physics/admin/solutions</p><p><br><strong>Mark Newman received a D.Phil. in physics from the University of Oxford in 1991 and conducted postdoctoral research at Cornell University before joining the staff of the Santa Fe Institute, a think-tank in New Mexico devoted to the study of complex systems.

It is likely to become the standard introductory textbook for the study of networks, and it is valuable as a desk-side reference for anyone who works with network problems." -- H. Van Dyke Parunak, <em>Computing Reviews</em><p></p><br>"An excellent textbook for the growing field of networks. It is cleverly written and suitable as both an introduction for undergraduate students and as a roadmap for graduate students. Furthermore, its more than 300 bibliographic references will guide readers who are interested in particular topics.

Flora Nwapa (1931-1993) sets her story in a small village in colonial West Africa as she describes the youth, marriage, motherhood, and eventual personal epiphany of a young woman in rural Nigeria. The respected and beautiful protagonist, an independent-minded Ibo woman named Efuru, wishes to be a mother. Her eventual tragedy is that she is not able to marry or raise children successfully. Alone and childless, Efuru realizes she surely must have a higher calling and goes to the lake goddess of her tribe, Uhamiri, to discover the path she must follow.<p> The work, a rich exploration of Nigerian village life and values, offers a realistic picture of gender issues in a patriarchal society as well as the struggles of a nation exploited by colonialism.</p><p> <b>Other titles by African writers from Waveland Press:</b></p><p> Amadi, <i>The Concubine</i> (ISBN 9781478634607)</p><p> Andreas, <i>The Purple Violet of Oshaantu</i> (ISBN 9781478634584)</p><p> Ba, <i>So Long a Letter</i> (ISBN 9781577668060)</p><p> Campbell, <i>My Children Have Faces</i> (ISBN 13 9781478635017)</p><p> Head, <i>The Collector of Treasures and Other Botswana Village Tales</i> (ISBN 9781478607601)</p><p> Head, <i>Maru</i> (ISBN 9781478607618)</p><p> Head, <i>A Question of Power</i> (ISBN 9781478634690)</p><p> Head, <i> When Rain Clouds Gather</i> (ISBN 9781478607595)</p><p> Kubuitsile, <i>The Scattering</i> (ISBN 9781478634591)</p><p> La Guma, <i>In the Fog of the Seasons' End</i> (ISBN 9781478600251)</p><p> p'Bitek, <i>Song of Lawino &amp; Song of Ocol</i> (ISBN 9781478604723)</p><p> Plaatje, <i>Mhudi</i> (ISBN 9781478609575)</p><p> Rifaat, <i>Distant Views of a Minaret and Other Short Stories</i> (ISBN 9781478611288)</p></p><p>"It's wonderful to discover this new Waveland reprint.

The next eleven chapters delve deeply into the elements of infrared technology. Chapter 13 explains the functional relationships between the various system elements and the effects of their interactions when assembled into a system. In Chapter 14 the reader is invited to watch the development of an infrared search system for commercial jet transports.<br> Part II contains an in-depth treatment of the applications of infrared techniques to the solution of military, industrial, medical, and scientific problems. It contains nearly 1400 annotated references to the infrared literature of the world. The annotations summarize the content, describe the hardware, details its performance and examine the significant results.

For those readers having the necessary credentials, Appendix 4 is a guide to the unpublished and classified literature of the infrared.</p><p></p><h2>American Political Thought</h2><p><p>In the wake of a precedent-setting presidential election and in the midst of a deepening economic recession, Dolbeare and Cummings challenge students to examine and understand their own political beliefs in historical context. Just as the 2008 elections brought race, gender, and age to the fore, the U.S. government&#x2019;s response to the Wall Street collapse highlights class issues and suddenly makes socialism relevant again. </p><p>Dolbeare and Cummings ask students to examine how the world today fits with the basic ideals of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness, as well as with the accepted tenets of private and free enterprise, the rule of law, institutional checks and balances, and the people&#x2019;s right to revolt against oppression. Rooted firmly in the economic conditions of each era, the editors&#x2019; commentary highlights issues of class and the clash of economic interests, while utilizing three organizing themes to help students understand the readings:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>the social and historical foundations of American political thought,</li><li>the key transformations in American political thought and practice, and&nbsp;</li><li>the individual and collective political identity of Americans. </li></ul><p>Each reading helps students to examine and understand their own political beliefs in historical context. In addition to adding a few key contributions from earlier times, the editors look purposefully toward contemporary thought, selecting readings that reflect on renewed citizen engagement, political change, and the impact of economic crisis on our notions of globalization. Are we seeing the disintegration of the conservative alliance? Can progressive change happen in a bipartisan or non-partisan fashion? Linking the transformations we are now witnessing to the ideas of the founders in a completely new Part 7, students can see the relevance that words written more than 200 years ago have for today&#x2019;s political world.</p></p><p><p><b>Kenneth M. Dolbeare</b> is a retired professor of political science who has taught at the Universities of Wisconsin, Washington, Massachusetts, and Colorado-Denver. He also taught for fifteen years at The Evergreen State College in Olympia, WA. In addition to his Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University, he received his LLB from Brooklyn Law School and is a member of the New York Bar. He is the author of several research monographs and other books, the most recent of which is <i>USA 2012: After the Middle Class Revolution</i> (1996).</p></p><h2>The Cornel West Reader</h2><p>Cornel West is one of the nation's premier public intellectuals and one of the great prophetic voices of our era. Whether he is writing a scholarly book or an article for Newsweek, whether he is speaking of Emerson, Gramsci, or Marvin Gaye, his work radiates a passion that reflects the rich traditions he draws on and weaves together�Baptist preaching, American transcendentalism, jazz, radical politics. This anthology reveals the dazzling range of West's work, from his explorations of &#x201d;Prophetic Pragmatism&#x201d; to his philosophizing on hip-hop. <i>The Cornel West Reader</i> traces the development of West's extraordinary career as academic, public intellectual, and activist. In his essays, articles, books, and interviews, West emerges as America's social conscience, urging attention to complicated issues of racial and economic justice, sexuality and gender, history and politics. This collection represents the best work of an always compelling, often controversial, and absolutely essential philosopher of the modern American experience.</p><p>Cornel West is Alphonse Fletcher, Jr., University Professor at Harvard University. He is the author of many books including <i>Prophetic Fragments</i>, <i>The Future of the Race</i> (with Henry Louis Gates, Jr.) and the bestselling <i>Race Matters</i>. He won an American Book Award in 1993 for his two-volume work <i>Beyond Eurocentrism and Multiculturalism</i>.An invaluable introduction to the writings of one our most prominent and prolific public intellectuals. West (Restoring Hope, 1997, etc.) is one of those rare African-American scholars who has been able to break out of the Black Studies ghetto not only in the academy but also in his widely and often popularly published work, as this hefty anthology plainly attests; at the same time, he asserts the continued power of Marxist thought without being confined to the only slightly less restrictive pigeonhole of socialist theory. He is as comfortable writing on William James and Josiah Royce as on Antonio Gramsci and Martin Luther King. And this retrospective collection certainly validates his stated desire ``to lay bare the basic structure of my intellectual work and life.'' Although much of the material has been published in book form before, West manages to put the pieces together in revealingly and economically thematic chunks. Those who find his technical and philosophical writings daunting will appreciate his more accessible interviews, including discussions with Bill Moyers, Anders Stephanson, and George Yancey (although a lengthy discussion of Georg Lukcs may leave most non-Marxists behind). Unfortunately, West does himself no great service with an introduction that is pompous, ponderous, and parodically self-satisfied. And while he refers to himself there as a ``Chekhovian Christian,'' West seems to have missed the dry humor that underpins much of Chekhov's best work, while understandably eschewing the rueful resignation of the Russian's plays. At his best, however, West is a lucid and serious thinker and an elegant and often impassioned writer, as this generous helping of his work reminds us.

Most of the 500 sketches, axonometric drawings, and photographs were created especially for this book. They explore the special qualities of places and the acts that can transform them into gardens.<br> <br> The authors discuss the qualities that create the promise of a garden the shapes of land and water, the established plants, the light and wind, the climate and show how these can be organized to give a place a special meaning. And they pay particular attention to the "rituals of habitation" by which we imaginatively take possession of places on the surface of the earth.<br> <br> <i>The Poetics of Gardens </i>examines great gardens made in other places, with other climates, at other times from ancient Rome to modem England, from Ball to Botany Bay, from the court of Ch'ien Lung to the magic kingdom of Walt Disney to explore their devices and record their images, scents, and sounds. The authors discuss the adaptation of the great garden traditions of the past to North American soil and call together the creators of these gardens to speculate about how their patterns and ideas can be appropriated, transformed, and composed into places that come alive for us.<br> <br> Charles W. Moore, one of America's best known architects, is O'Neil Ford Professor of Architecture at the University of Texas at Austin. William J. Mitchell is Professor of Architecture at Harvard University. William Turnbull, Jr. is Principal of William Turnbull Associates, San Francisco.</p><p>William J. Mitchell was the Alexander W. Dreyfoos, Jr., Professor of Architecture and Media Arts and Sciences and directed the Smart Cities research group at MIT's Media Lab. He authored many books, including <i>The World's Greatest Architect</i> (2008) and <i>Placing Words: Symbols, Space, and the City</i> (2005), both published by the MIT Press.An ambitious and highly idiosyncratic work, this offers an invaluable bird's- and worm's-eye view of gardensaround the world and over the span of human historyas highly-wrought artifacts and everyday dwelling-places. With erudition and uncommon imagination, the authors consider the history and anthropology of gardens, their evolving esthetic principles, their architecture, their place in philosophy and literature, and the purposes they have served in religion, deftly compressing encyclopedic findings in urbane prose. They discuss the raw materials of garden sites, provide a "catalogue of compositional strategies" for gardeners, define types of gardens in terms of form and function, offer a sweeping survey of cultivated landscapesfrom ancient Rome's to Walt Disney'sand conclude by summoning a pantheon of illustrious gardeners, thinkers and outspoken bystanders (Vita Sackville-West, Lucian, Frank Lloyd Wright, King Kong) to discuss, in a perceptive and madcap fantasy colloquy, some practical problems of design facing contemporary American gardeners. Moore, Mitchell and Turnbull view gardens as "rhetorical landscapes" to be "read for content"; to them, "A garden path can become the thread of a plot" that leads us to the heart of a culture when the garden's "devices of structure and figure and trope" are analyzed. Yet their richly illustrated book is also a spirited travel guide, evoking the "garden palace" of the Alhambra and the "anorexic palm trees of Beverly Hills, poking at a smog-bruised sky." They appraise horticultural marvels, but also those of civilization at large. Theirs is an exhilarating sourcebook, an exemplary refuge for the restless gardener's imaginationone to savor and ponder as an essential on the shelf.

In this revealing new book, Webb takes readers through every aspect of this training, describing how Spec Ops snipers are taught each dimension of their art. Trainees learn to utilize every edge possible to make their shot--from studying crosswinds, barometric pressure, latitude, and even the rotation of the Earth to becoming ballistic experts. But marksmanship is only one aspect of the training. Each SEAL's endurance, stealth and mental and physical stamina are tested and pushed to the breaking point.<br>Webb also shows how this training plays out in combat, using real-life exploits of the world's top snipers, including Jason Delgado, who led a Marine platoon in the Battle of Husaybah and made some of the most remarkable kill shots in the Iraq War; Nicholas Irving, the U.S. Army Ranger credited with thirty-three kills in a single three-month tour in Afghanistan; and Rob Furlong, who during Operation Anaconda delivered the then-longest kill shot in history.<br>During Webb's sniper school tenure, the course graduated some of the deadliest and most skilled snipers of this generation, including Marcus Luttrell (<i>Lone Survivor</i>), Adam Brown (<i>Fearless</i>), and Chris Kyle (<i>American Sniper</i>). From recon and stalk, to complex last minute adjustments, and finally the moment of taking the shot, <i>The Killing School </i>demonstrates how today's sniper is trained to function as an entire military operation rolled into a single individual--an army of one.</p></p><p><p>BRANDON WEBB is the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Red Circle</i><i>.</i> A former U.S. Navy SEAL, he has received numerous distinguished service awards, including the Presidential Unit Citation.

Smith, as before, gives lay readers a narrative stripped of academic fittings. Ironically, he is best in traditional historical areas like the New Deal, here praised highly. He goes on to embrace all else he finds, from literature to gospel music to foreign policy to medicine. Often the text has a newsreel quality, the segments vivid, shallow, and abrupt. History's tendency, says Smith, "is downward, toward complacency, decadence, obtuseness, and coldness of heart"; but always at work are the redemptive forces he usually finds on the left. At times elevated by passion and wit, the book is weighed down by Smith's ambitious scope. For public libraries. BOMC alternate. Robert F.

Peter Pettinger, himself a concert pianist, describes Evans&#x2019;s life (the personal tragedies and commercial successes), his musicmaking (technique, compositional methods, and approach to group playing), and his legacy. The book also includes a full discography and dozens of photographs.</p><p>Perhaps it was a white jazz musician&#39;s need to negate his very ordinary American boyhood, or maybe it was in the genes he inherited from his alcoholic father--no one can be quite sure--but Bill Evans, one of the most influential American jazz pianists ever, was a drug addict. He picked up his habit shortly after joining the Miles Davis Sextet in the 1950s, but it took Evans more than 20 years to be swallowed by the abyss of heroin, methadone, and cocaine. Sitting at the piano in the shadow of Davis, John Coltrane, Cannonball Adderley, Paul Chambers, and Philly Joe Jones--the era&#39;s paragons of cool--could not have been easy for the retiring musician who suffered harsh ribbing at the hands of both bandmates and fans. Ironically, as the drugs distorted Evans&#39;s body and soul, his fingers coaxed ever more sublime music from his keyboard. Biographer Peter Pettinger was himself a professional pianist and a longtime listener of Evans, so he is expert at articulating the nuances of the music. He is perceptive too in exploring the forces that imbued in one life so much beauty and so much pain. The result is a book that is both a memorial to a burdened man and an homage to his transcendent music."[A] fine new biography... packed with... shrewd critical commentary." -Terry Teachout, New York Times Book Review <p>"Pettinger sets out to catalogue and explain Evans' wide-ranging genius... The making of every important Evans recording is discussed, and as he follows the extreme ups and downs of a career vexed by heroin addiction and other problems, Pettinger shows how the personal helped shape the artistic sensibility of this jazz innovator." -Tom Moon, Philadelphia Inquirer </p><p>Selected as a 1998 Notable Book of the Year by the New York Times Book Review </p><p>Winner of the 1999 ASCAP-Deems Taylor Award in the Pop Books Category</p></p><h2>Vander&#39;s Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function, 12th Edition</h2><p>Vander&#39;s Human Physiology: The Mechanisms of Body Function.

It also includes all the variant versions to be found in the original manuscript sources (which are now given in detail). The original English translation has been extensively revised to suit the different editorial principles on which the revised edition has been produced.</p>Born in Vienna, Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein was educated at Linz and Berlin University. In 1908 he went to England, registering as a research student in engineering at the University of Manchester. There he studied Bertrand Russell&#39;s (see also Vol. 5) Principles of Mathematics by chance and decided to study with Russell at Cambridge University. From 1912 to 1913, he studied under Russell&#39;s supervision and began to develop the ideas that crystallized in his Tractatus. With the outbreak of World War I, he returned home and volunteered for the Austrian Army. During his military service, he prepared the book published in 1921 as the Tractatus, first translated into English in 1922 by C. K. Ogden. Wittgenstein emerged as a philosopher whose influence spread from Austria to the English-speaking world. Perhaps the most eminent philosopher during the second half of the twentieth century, Wittgenstein had an early impact on the members of the Vienna Circle, with which he was associated. The logical atomism of the Tractatus, with its claims that propositions of logic and mathematics are tautologous and that the cognitive meaning of other sorts of scientific statements is empirical, became the fundamental source of logical positivism, or logical empiricism. Bertrand Russell adopted it as his position, and A. J. Ayer was to accept and profess it 15 years later. From the end of World War I until 1926, Wittgenstein was a schoolteacher in Austria. In 1929 his interest in philosophy renewed, and he returned to Cambridge, where even G. E. Moore came under his spell. At Cambridge Wittgenstein began a new wave in philosophical analysis distinct from the Tractatus, which had inspired the rise of logical positivism. Whereas the earlier Wittgenstein had concentrated on the formal structures of logic and mathematics, the later Wittgenstein attended to the fluidities of ordinary language. His lectures, remarks, conversations, and letters made lasting imprints on the minds of his most brilliant students, who have long since initiated the unending process of publishing them. During his lifetime Wittgenstein himself never published another book after the Tractatus. However, he was explicit that the work disclosing the methods and topics of his later years be published. This work, Philosophical Investigations (1953), is esteemed to be his most mature expression of his philosophical method and thought.</p><h2>Education in the New Age</h2><p>Of the few specialised subjects included in these books by Alice Bailey and the Tibetan, education is of primary importance. Today we are losing the tendency to associate "education" only with the instruction of the young and with academic matters. Education is, or should be, a continuous process from birth to death concerned not so much with the acquisition or knowledge as with the expansion of consciousness. Knowledge of itself is a dead end, unless it is brought into functioning relationship with environment, social responsibilities, historical trends, human and world conditions and, above all, with the evolution of consciousness which brings the infinite vastness of an unknown universe within the range of the finite human mind. <br><br>To oversimplify, can we say that education is a continuous process of learning how to reconcile the human and the divine elements in the constitution of man, creating right relationship between God and man, spirit and matter, the whole and the part? <br><br>If this is education in the broader sense, it is more specific and more concentrated when considered in the light of child training. This book is so concentrated and specific. While presenting the need for wholeness--development of the whole person, spirit, soul and body as an integrated unity, and acceptance of the planetary whole as the area of personal experience and responsibility--the educational needs of the child today are set out in specific terms. Faults and inadequacies in the present educational systems existing in many parts of the world are enumerated, and methods for the future suggested. <br><br>Emphasis is placed on the need for education in world citizenship. Even before this book was first published this need had become startlingly apparent. It is also clear, however, that since children naturally tend to accept without question those of other nations, other races, colour, belief and social background, a world consciousness and inclusiveness must first be generated in those adults responsible for the education and the training of the young.<br><br>Therefore, this book includes a brief final chapter on "the science of the Antahkarana", that is, with the creative effort to bridge in consciousness between the lower analytical, knowledge-gathering mind, the soul, and the higher mind which is an aspect of the divine Self, the spiritual man. This is a scientific process which can be studied and practiced as a meditation technique, combined with the effort to apply spiritual principles to the daily life under any and all circumstances. <br><br>The building of the Antahkarana, literally a bridge between the subjective and objective worlds, creates a channel for the transmission of spiritual energies--light and love and power. These energies transform the daily life, irradiate the personality and infuse the mind with creative thought consistent with the needs of the emerging Plan at the dawning of a new age. So the enlightened adult can stimulate the soul of the child, enrich and enliven the mind, and provide right opportunities for full development of the spiritual potential.</p><p>Alice A. Bailey, (1880-1949) From her conservative British background, Alice Bailey&#39;s life led her in many directions, but always in one direction--towards the time when through drastic personal experience of many kinds she had acquired a synthesis of outlook and understanding, and an absolute conviction that one divine life pervades and animates the one humanity; that the Plan for humanity requires the cooperation and service of trained and dedicated human beings intelligently informed about world affairs, in collaboration with those who form the spiritual Hierarchy, the inner government of the planet. Her life work became an integral part of this synthesis and this realization. Without in the least losing any of her very human qualities and involvement, her soul took up its commitment to her Master,and her personality provided full cooperation in the field of her accepted service. Basically her work developed as a duality--her discipleship service which included the establishment of an esoteric school; and her initially reluctant agreement to work with the Tibetan, Djwhal Khul, in the writing of a series of books presenting the next phase in the continuity of the Ageless Wisdom teaching for the present and the immediate future.Alice Bailey established Lucis Publishing Company to provide a vehicle for publishing the books that she wrote, making the teachings of Djwhal Khul available to spiritual seekers and students around the world. Mrs. Bailey&#39;s books have been in constant distributution for over 75 years.

They show how children are often mislabeled with diagnoses that are too broad (ADHD, for instance) or are simply inaccurate. They also explain why medications are often not the best ways to help children who are struggling to learn. The authors guide readers through the morass of commonly used labels and treatments, offering specific suggestions that can be used to help children at school and at home.<br><br> This book offers extremely empowering information for parents and professionals alike. <em>The Mislabeled Child</em> examines a full spectrum of learning disorders, from dyslexia to giftedness, clarifying the diagnoses and providing resources to help. The Eides explain how a learning disability encompasses more than a behavioral problem; it is also a brain dysfunction that should be treated differently.</p><p><strong>Brock Eide, M.D., M.A.</strong>, and <strong>Fernette Eide, M.D.</strong>, are leading researchers and clinicians on learning disabilities. They run the Eide Neurolearning Clinic and lecture throughout the US and Canada to parents, educators, therapists and doctors.Because of the propensity of schools and society to label children, the Eides, physicians who specialize in treating children with learning challenges, want to ensure the accuracy of those labels. In their practice, they have seen children with misdiagnosed, undiagnosed, and untreated disabilities who are called lazy or underachievers. But the Eides emphasize that even the correct label does not define a child. The Eides show readers how to determine children's learning strengths and weaknesses and how to make the most of their potential. They focus on assessing children's learning systems, using that information to complete a learning profile, and using the profile to design a program of education, therapy, and play. The Eides offer physiological research on brain development, and how learning disabilities tie into behavior difficulties. The Eides get a bit academic at points, but they intersperse case studies that keep the material accessible as they examine a range of learning disabilities from ADHD to dyslexia and dysgraphia. A valuable resource for parents and educators. <i>Vanessa Bush</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

The second of eight children of a family continually plagued by debt, the young Dickens came to know not only hunger and privation,but also the horror of the infamous debtors&#x2019; prison and the evils of child labor. A turn of fortune in the shape of a legacy brought release from the nightmare of prison and &#x201c;slave&#x201d; factories and afforded Dickens the opportunity of two years&#x2019; formal schooling at Wellington House Academy. He worked as an attorney&#x2019;s clerk and newspaper reporter until his <b>Sketches by Boz</b> (1836) and <b>The Pickwick Papers</b> (1837) brought him the amazing and instant success that was to be his for the remainder of his life. In later years, the pressure of serial writing, editorial duties, lectures, and social commitments led to his separation from Catherine Hogarth after twenty-three years of marriage. It also hastened his death at the age of fifty-eight, when he was characteristically engaged in a multitude of work.</p></p><h2>Journey Toward the Caring Classroom 2nd Edition: Using Adventure to Create Community</h2><p>Journey Toward the Caring Classroom, 2nd Edition, deftly bridges the gap between conventional and experiential education, empowering educators/facilitators to use their minds, intuition, and knowledge along with a growing body of evidence to create an environment that supports learning, community building, and social-emotional development. Educational theory, concrete in-class strategies, and engaging activities encourage educators to transform their classroom into a caring place where every learner can grow.</p><p>Laurie Frank is a former public school teacher who has worked in the adventure and experiential education arenas for over 30 years. She began her career as a special education teacher in emotional disabilities, working with students of all ages. Her path diverged upon the discovery of adventure education and experiential methodologies. The need to develop a sense of community within the school setting was apparent, and the adventure philosophy seemed the perfect vehicle to achieve that goal.<br>Laurie is the owner/director of GOAL Consulting, working with people of all ages to create environments where everyone is invited into the process of working and learning together. Her major focuses are community building, collaborative leadership, experiential education, and Appreciative Inquiry. Workshops with Laurie invite engagement by constructing knowledge through experience and exploration.<br>Ms. Frank was a leader in designing the nationally recognized Stress/Challenge adventure program for Madison (Wisconsin) Metropolitan School District, and wrote their curriculum, Adventure in the Classroom, in 1988. Since then, she has had the opportunity to work with educators throughout North America and the world to explore experiential teaching and learning methodologies that honor people s commonalities and transcend the bounds of culture. <br>Laurie s passion is to facilitate human interaction, and to create environments where everyone is empowered. A few of her projects include: YEP (Youth Empowerment Process), Inquiry Institute with the Chicago Teacher s Center, and Collaborative Leadership: a project of the Wisconsin Leadership Institute. She currently serves on the boards of the Hancock Center for Dance/Movement Therapy, The United World College-Costa Rica and UWC Council, Students Abroad for Global Education (SAGE), and Recovery Acceleration then Competence and Excellence (R.A.C.E.) Academies.This book re-casts the classroom teacher as educator/facilitator/guide. It is user friendly and empowers teachers to cultivate flexibility within their educational practice and to use their mind, intuition, knowledge, and the growing body of research available to identify where their students actually are and give them what they need, not what standards say are appropriate. <br> The theory, research, and discussion of social/emotional competencies is solid! This is what we need to make our case in public and conventional private schools. This book is timely and appropriate in that it meets schools needs and desires for culture and climate change, addressing bullying, social justice, and social emotional development while balancing those needs against the needs for research-based instruction and curriculum design and the requirements to meet state standards (in many cases).<br> I thoroughly enjoyed reviewing this work, particularly as a user of the previous book, as a facilitator, experiential educator, and teacher in a huge public school. I applaud the work Frank has done here, and am excited to see how she developed her work to keep up with where education seems to be headed. --Steph Frigon, MS Experiential Education, Director of Experiential &amp; Challenge Course Programming, Cooperative Middle School, Stratham, NH<br><br>Journey Toward the Caring Classroom, 2nd Edition, brings to life all of the key concepts in teaching and facilitating healthy learning.

For classical architects, the term Palladian stands for a vocabulary of architectural forms embodying perfection and beauty. Of even greater significance than Palladio's buildings is his treatise I quattro libri dell'architettura (The Four Books On Architecture), the most successful architectural treatise of the Renaissance and one of the two or three most important books in the literature of architecture. First published in Italian in 1570, it has been translated into every major Western language.This is the first English translation of Palladio in over 250 years, making it the only translation available in modern English. Until now, English-language readers have had to rely mostly on a facsimile of Isaac Ware's 1738 translation and the eighteenth-century engravings prepared for that text. This new translation by Robert Tavernor and Richard Schofield contains Palladio's original woodcuts, reproduced in facsimile and positioned correctly, adjacent to the text. The book also contains a glossary that explains technical terms in their original context, a bibliography of recent Palladio research, and an introduction to Palladio and his times.The First Book discusses building materials and techniques, as well as the five orders of architecture: Tuscan, Doric, Ionic, Corinthian, and Composite. Palladio describes the characteristics of each order and illustrates them. The Second Book discusses private town houses and country estates, almost all designed by Palladio. The Third Book discusses streets, bridges, piazzas, and basilicas, most of ancient Roman origin. The Fourth Book discusses ancient Roman temples, including the Pantheon.</p></p><p><p>Richard Schofield is Professor of Architectural History at the Instituto universitario di architettura at Venice (IUAV).

By 1980, it had become the country's most popular ethnic cuisine. <i>Chop Suey, USA</i> offers the first comprehensive interpretation of the rise of Chinese food, revealing the forces that made it ubiquitous in the American gastronomic landscape and turned the country into an empire of consumption.<br><br>Engineered by a politically disenfranchised, numerically small, and economically exploited group, Chinese food's tour de America is an epic story of global cultural encounter. It reflects not only changes in taste but also a growing appetite for a more leisurely lifestyle. Americans fell in love with Chinese food not because of its gastronomic excellence but because of its affordability and convenience, which is why they preferred the quick and simple dishes of China while shunning its haute cuisine. Epitomized by chop suey, American Chinese food was a forerunner of McDonald's, democratizing the once-exclusive dining-out experience for such groups as marginalized Anglos, African Americans, and Jews. <br><br>The rise of Chinese food is also a classic American story of immigrant entrepreneurship and perseverance. Barred from many occupations, Chinese Americans successfully turned Chinese food from a despised cuisine into a dominant force in the restaurant market, creating a critical lifeline for their community. Chinese American restaurant workers developed the concept of the open kitchen and popularized the practice of home delivery. They streamlined certain Chinese dishes, such as chop suey and egg foo young, turning them into nationally recognized brand names.</p><p>Yong Chen, raised by his food-loving mother in China, is professor of history at the University of California, Irvine, and served as the institution's associate dean of graduate studies. Among his numerous publications are <i>Chinese San Francisco, 1850&#x2013;1943: A Trans-Pacific Community</i>. He co-curated a museum exhibit on the history of Chinese restaurants in the United States, and his commentaries on food, immigration, and Sino-American relations appear frequently in the media in four languages.Well organized and breathtakingly broad in its geographic scope, <i>Chop Suey, USA</i> is an utterly original and significant contribution to the field. Yong Chen has done a superb job. No one has attempted anything like this.

(Jeffrey Pilcher, University of Toronto)<br><br>Food is not just about sustenance and taste. It is also about culture, economics, race, and identity. This is made abundantly clear in this fascinating account of the history of Chinese food in America. Chop Suey, USA is a wonderful American story, and a tasty one at that! (Gordon H. Chang, Stanford University)<br><br>A perceptive view of an America built on abundance and consumption... Well-researched... (<i>Kirkus</i>)<br><br>Reading Yong Chen's new book... is an education.

Businesses are beginning to re-embrace this truth, and to realize that Big Data reveals only part of the customer's story. Marketing surveys have indicated that, within the next couple of years, at least 80 percent of all marketers will be using buyer personas to define their audiences and guide business strategies. Those who have already tried the technique have been amazed by its ease and value, yet, for many, buyer personas are still not translating to increased business. <i>Buyer Personas</i> is a long-awaited how-to guide for marketers who want to implement buyer-expert marketing <i>effectively</i>. </p><p>Creating buyer personas is the process of conducting one-on-one interviews with customers to get a handle on their mind-sets, understand their purchasing decisions, and build three-dimensional profiles of real buyers. But how are these interviews conducted? And then what? <i>Buyer Personas</i> addresses these questions in a concise and refreshingly relatable way. Adele Revella hopscotches over fads and hysteria to prove that asking customers about their decisions--and then systematically analyzing their answers--is one of the most powerful strategies around. </p><p>"Know your customer" is an adage as old as marketing itself, but, in the digital era, many are forgetting this timeless truth. Although it's possible to gather mountains of information on just about anything, no amount of data will help marketers understand customers as well--or as quickly--as simply listening. Interview a customer tomorrow morning, and by tomorrow afternoon you will have robust new knowledge of how your buyers think, without any of the pitfalls that accompany less people-centered approaches. </p><p><i>Buyer Personas</i> provides immediately actionable, step-by-step procedures and answers to the questions that marketers ask as they begin to build and use buyer personas. Beginning with the principles of buyer persona marketing, then proceeding to a practical method for contract or in-house buyer persona development, the book concludes with the most crucial element--making use of buyer personas once they have been generated. Countless examples show that this last step is where too many marketing executives fall short. They focus on the goal of creating buyer personas without a clear plan that guarantees a useful outcome. The third section of <i>Buyer Personas</i> assures that the buyer persona initiative leads to sales and marketing activities that measurably impact business goals.</p></p><h2>Teaching Children&#39;s Literature: It&#39;s Critical!</h2><p><p>This groundbreaking text offers a fresh perspective on how to implement children&#x2019;s literature into and across the curriculum in ways that are both effective and purposeful.

Covering everything from creation to destruction, this ancient poem remains an indelible part of Hindu culture and a landmark in ancient literature.<br> <br> Centuries of listeners and readers have been drawn to <i>The Mahabharata</i>, which began as disparate oral ballads and grew into a sprawling epic. The modern version is famously long, and at more than 1.8 million words&#x2014;seven times the combined lengths of the Iliad and Odyssey&#x2014;it can be incredibly daunting.<br> <br> Contemporary readers have a much more accessible entry point to this important work, thanks to R. K. Narayan&#x2019;s masterful translation and abridgement of the poem. Now with a new foreword by Wendy Doniger, as well as a concise character and place guide and a family tree, <i>The Mahabharata</i> is ready for a new generation of readers. As Wendy Doniger explains in the foreword, &#x201c;Narayan tells the stories so well because they&#x2019;re all his stories.&#x201d; He grew up hearing them, internalizing their mythology, which gave him an innate ability to choose the right passages and their best translations.<br> <br> In this elegant translation, Narayan ably distills a tale that is both traditional and constantly changing. He draws from both scholarly analysis and creative interpretation and vividly fuses the spiritual with the secular. Through this balance he has produced a translation that is not only clear, but graceful, one that stands as its own story as much as an adaptation of a larger work.<br></p></p><p>The <i>Mahabharata</i>, together with the other great Sanskrit epic, the <i>Ramayana</i>, embodies much of the cultural and religious heritage of India. Based on the narrative of the great war between the Kauravas and the Pandavas, it tells of warriors, kings, saints, and goddesses caught up in the romance and drama of family intrigue. With its diversity of plots and themes-including the philosophical teachings of the <i>Bhagavada Gita</i>-the <i>Mahabharata</i> has entertained and influenced Indian audiences for nearly two thousand years. R. K. Narayan's abbreviated prose version provides a superb and elegant rendition of this great epic.<b>R. K. Narayan</b> (1906&#x2013;2001) was one of the most prominent Indian novelists of the twentieth century. Most of his stories are set in the fictional South Indian town of Malgudi, a place that Narayan populated with numerous characters. He was the recipient of&nbsp;many awards for his work including the National Prize of the Indian Literary Academy, India's highest literary honor. In 1980 he was awarded the AC Benson Medal by the Royal Society of Literature, of which he was an honorary member and in 1982 he was elected an honorary member of the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<br><br><b>Wendy Doniger</b> is the Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions in the Divinity School and a professor in the Department of South Asian Languages and Civilizations and the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.</p><h2>Attention Deficit Disorder: The Unfocused Mind in Children and Adults (Yale University Press Health &amp; Wellness)</h2><p><b>A new understanding of ADD, along with practical information on how to recognize and treat the disorder</b><br><br> A leading expert in the assessment and treatment of Attention Deficit Disorder/Attention Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder dispels myths and offers reassuring, practical information about treatments.

Dr. Brown disputes the &#x201c;willpower&#x201d; explanation and explains how inherited malfunctions of the brain&#x2019;s management system prevent some people from being able to deal adequately with challenging tasks of childhood, adolescence, and adulthood. His book is an authoritative and practical guide for physicians and psychologists, parents and teachers, and the 7 to 9 percent of persons who suffer from ADD/ADHD.</p><p>"...a fine book, rich with clinical anecdotes that provide great insight into ADD/ADHD... and scientifically based recommendations for the management of the disorder...Well done and well worth reading." -&#x2014; Russell A.

But forensic analysis has been practiced for thousands of years. Ancient Chinese detectives studied dead bodies for signs of foul play, and in Victorian England, officials used crime scene photography and criminal profiling to investigate the Jack the Ripper murders. In the intervening decades, forensic science has evolved to use the most cutting-edge, innovative techniques and technologies.</p><p>In this book, acclaimed author Bridget Heos uses real-life cases to tell the history of modern forensic science, from the first test for arsenic poisoning to fingerprinting, firearm and blood spatter analysis, DNA evidence, and all the important milestones in between. By turns captivating and shocking, <em>Blood, Bullets, and Bones</em> demonstrates the essential role forensic science has played in our criminal justice system.</p></p><p>Gr 8 Up&#x2014;The use of DNA evidence by forensic scientists to help solve crimes is a relatively new innovation. It was only in 1994 that the FBI created a database of DNA samples from convicted and suspected criminals called the Combined DNA Index System (CODIS). However, the field of forensic science has been around for centuries. In fact, as early as 270 CE there was Zhang Ju, a Chinese coroner who wrote about the crimes he solved by examining the bodies of the victims. Using numerous real-life cases, Heos presents a riveting history of the evolution of modern forensic science. One of the first scientific tests ever developed in relation to murder was one for determining the presence of poison, in particular arsenic. This 18th-century breakthrough laid the groundwork for countless other developments in the quest to solve crimes. Heos deftly incorporates the stories behind many murders to illuminate advancements in areas such as fingerprint evidence, firearm and blood pattern analysis, and forensic anthropology (how bodies decompose).

You won't find even the shadow of a Micawber or a Mrs. Gamp anywhere in this brief volume; no Pecksniffs, Podsnaps, or Mulberries, either. Instead, Dickens approaches his subject with simple reverence, retelling the New Testament in a manner suitable for his own young children--who were, in fact, his only intended audience. Indeed, he strictly forbade publication of <i>The Life</i> during his lifetime and begged his sister to make sure that they "would never even hand the manuscript, or a copy of it, to anyone to take out of the house." It wasn't until the death of Dickens's last living son that the manuscript was finally published in 1934. Though he left his trademark comedy behind, Dickens's liberal social conscience is still evident in what he chooses to emphasize about Jesus: "My Dear Children," he begins, <blockquote>I am very anxious that you should know something about the History of Jesus Christ. For everybody ought to know about Him. No one ever lived who was so good, so kind, so gentle, and so sorry for all people who did wrong, or were in any way ill or miserable, as He was.</blockquote> This is a simple, straightforward account of Jesus' life and teachings, with an occasional touch of whimsy: "You never saw a locust, because they belong to that country near Jerusalem, which is a great way off. So do camels, but I think you have seen a camel. At all events, they are brought over here, sometimes; and if you would like to see one, I will show you one." Occasionally, Victorian attitudes and prejudices creep through--Dickens writes that the Jewish Sabbath was Sunday, that Jews were "very ignorant and passionate," and also that "they were very proud, and believed that no people were good but themselves." Fortunately, such comments are few and far between, and for the most part the author focuses on the miracles Jesus performed and on the lessons in charity, forgiveness, and compassion that Christians can take away from them. This may not be among the greatest of Charles Dickens's literary accomplishments, but it is certainly one of his most heartfelt. <i>--Sheila Bright</i>Charles Dickens wrote The Life of Our Lord during the years 1846-1849, just about the time he was completing David Copperfield. In this charming, simple retelling of the life of Jesus Christ, adapted from the Gospel of St. Luke, Dickens hoped to teach his young children about religion and faith. Since he wrote it exclusively for his children, Dickens refused to allow publication.<p>For eighty-five years the manuscript was guarded as a precious family secret, and it was handed down from one relative to the next. When Dickens died in 1870, it was left to his sister-in-law, Georgina Hogarth. From there it fell to Dickens's son, Sir Henry Fielding Dickens, with the admonition that it should not be published while any child of Dickens lived.</p><p>Just before the 1933 holidays, Sir Henry, then the only living child of Dickens, died, leaving his father's manuscript to his wife and children. He also bequeathed to them the right to make the decision to publish The Life of Our Lord. By majority vote, Sir Henry's widow and children decided to publish the book in London. In 1934, Simon &amp; Schuster published the first American edition, which became one of the year's biggest bestsellers.</p></p><h2>Schaum&#39;s Outline of Mathematical Handbook of Formulas and Tables, 3ed (Schaum&#39;s Outline Series)</h2><p><p><b>Schaum's has Satisfied Students for 50 Years.</b></p><b> </b><p><b>Now Schaum's Biggest Sellers are in New Editions!</b></p> <p>For half a century, more than 40 million students have trusted Schaum's to help them study faster, learn better, and get top grades.

Resurgence refers to practices of Indigenous self-determination and cultural renewal whereas reconciliation refers to practices of reconciliation between Indigenous and Settler nations, such as nation-with-nation treaty negotiations. Reconciliation also refers to the sustainable reconciliation of both Indigenous and Settler peoples with the living earth as the grounds for both resurgence and Indigenous-Settler reconciliation.</p><br><p>Critically and constructively analyzing these two schools from a wide variety of perspectives and lived experiences, this volume connects both discourses to the ecosystem dynamics that animate the living earth. <em>Resurgence and Reconciliation</em> is multi-disciplinary, blending law, political science, political economy, women's studies, ecology, history, anthropology, sustainability, and climate change. Its dialogic approach strives to put these fields in conversation and draw out the connections and tensions between them. </p><br><p>By using &#x201c;earth-teachings&#x201d; to inform social practices, the editors and contributors offer a rich, innovative, and holistic way forward in response to the world&#x2019;s most profound natural and social challenges. This timely volume shows how the complexities and interconnections of resurgence and reconciliation and the living earth are often overlooked in contemporary discourse and debate. </p></p><p><strong>Michael Asch</strong> is a professor emeritus in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Alberta and a professor (limited term) in the Department of Anthropology and adjunct professor in the Department of Political Science at the University of Victoria. <br> <b>John Borrows</b> is Professor and Canada Research Chair in Indigenous Law at the University of Victoria Law School.<br> <b>James Tully</b> is emeritus distinguished professor of Political Science, Law, Indigenous Governance, and Philosophy at the University of Victoria.<br><p><strong>Introduction</strong></p><br><p><strong>Reconciliation and Resurgence in Practice and in Question</strong></p><br><p>Reconciliation and resurgence have become ways of describing the field of activities, relationships, and possible futures between Indigenous and settler people. Over the last two decades these terms have been widely used in practice: in community building, relating to the environment, Indigenous and settler governance and legal institutions, business, media, entertainment, commissions, alliances, negotiations, prison reform, and protests. They are also broadly deployed in academic circles. They are the focus of research, teaching, reflection, and activism in university settings and beyond. Movements like Idle No More and Standing with Standing Rock relay these ideas. They are variously used by leaders like Chief Spence of the Attawapiskat First Nation, Chief Stewart Philip and the Union of BC Indian Chiefs, and numerous chiefs and officials in the Assembly of First Nations. The language of resurgence and reconciliation also finds its way into broader political discourse. Federal, provincial, and municipal governments, as well as the media and wider public, invoke these ideas when considering the appalling living conditions of many Indigenous peoples. In particular, the designation of 2017 as the year of reconciliation gave these terms heightened prominence and urgency.</p><br><p>As a result of their widespread acceptance and usage, and because so much is at stake, reconciliation and resurgence are used in a wide variety of ways. These terms are continuously contested and reformulated in practice, policy, and academic research. Thus practice-based struggles over reconciliation and resurgence are also struggles over the meanings of the terms themselves. Reconciliation and resurgence have become contestable and contested concepts within the semantic field and human activities in which they are used.</p><br><p>For example, some say reconciliation between settlers and Indigenous peoples is an end state of some kind: a contract, agreement, legal recognition, return of stolen land, reparations, compensation, closing the gap, or self-determination. Others argue that it is more akin to an ongoing activity. Some say reconciliation embodies a relationship stretching back 12,000 years, an existential mode of being with one another and the living earth. It has also been associated with treaty relationships since early contact. For some it is the path to decolonization, for others a new form of recolonization. Some insist reconciliation must be resisted, while others see it as an essential process for ongoing relationality.</p><br><p>Resurgence is often used to refer to Indigenous peoples exercising powers of self-determination outside of state structures and paradigms. It is deployed by communities as a force for reclaiming and reconnecting with traditional territories by means of Indigenous ways of knowing and being. These individual and collective powers include the resurgence of governance, Indigenous legal systems and languages, economic and social self-reliance, and sustainable relationships with the ecosystems that co-sustain all life and well-being. Resurgence also refers to analogous Indigenous practices in rural and urban centres, universities, prisons, other institutions, and global networks. Some see these as new activities. Others see them as ancient life ways that stretch back through the centuries. Settlers also use the term. It can refer to decolonizing activities, enacted in alliance with Indigenous people or independently, yet in solidarity with them.</p><br><p>Some practitioners of resurgence refuse and reject reconciliation based relationships between settler and Indigenous peoples, claiming they are assimilative or colonizing. Others, including many Indigenous people, feel a more nuanced approach is required. They strive to live more holistically and navigate the tensions they experience creative ways. They are uncomfortable with dramatically turning away from their neighbours. While they strenuously resist oppression, they understand their deeper values require more constructively provocative approaches. Isolationism can lead to self-absorption and become marginalizing and disempowering. Dense relationships of interdependency are thus cultivated by many practitioners of resurgence, with many different sites of action, inaction, resistance, and cooperation. Robust practices of resurgence often (though not always) need to be coordinated and nested within robust, non-violent, contentious relationships of transformative reconciliation with supportive settlers, just as practices of resurgence require the same kind of empowering contestation, coordination, and reconciliation within and among Indigenous communities. </p><br><p>At times the difference between &#x201c;separate resurgence&#x201d; and resurgence and reconciliation (or &#x201c;resurgence-reconciliation&#x201d;) has been polarized. Disagreements among practitioners can be divisive in both theory and practice. This volume identifies diverse paths that attempt to move beyond this polarization and the disempowering divisions it generates. We accept critiques and refusals of so-called reconciliation models that threaten to reconcile Indigenous peoples to the unjust status quo. We also acknowledge and accept critiques and refusals of certain types of &#x201c;recognition&#x201d; that place the state or its imperial networks at the centre of social, political, and economic affairs. Recognition can be a Trojan horse&#x2013;like gift; state action often operates to overpower or deflect Indigenous resurgence. Indeed, the contributors to this volume have co-developed these critiques and refusals with others. In turning from critique to construction, we distinguish between two form and meanings of reconciliation and resurgence. The first are those that perpetuate unjust relationships of dispossession, domination, exploitation, and patriarchy. These reconcile Indigenous people and settlers to the status quo, and we strongly reject them. The second are those that have the potential to transform these unjust relationships; these are the kinds of ideas we seek to advance in this book. These are relationships of &#x201c;transformative&#x201d; reconciliation. To be transformative they must be empowered by robust practices of resurgence. Robust resurgence infuses reciprocal practices of reconciliation in self-determining, self-sustaining, and inter-generational ways. These unique forms of reconciliation and resurgence coexist in a relationship of gift-reciprocity, as many contributors argue. For example, the creation of resurgent Indigenous Studies programs often (though not invariably) grew from reconciliation efforts with settler partners in university settings. These programs, run by Indigenous scholars, have transformed curricula and teaching in their disciplines over the last twenty years &#x2013; not only for their resurgent units but also for their partners whose reconciliation efforts were vital to their development. Unfortunately, despite the significant growth of resurgence-reconciliation networks and frameworks, all is not well in the field. Polarizing debates have developed through misunderstandings and/or misuses of the different meanings of resurgence and reconciliation. This volume seeks to clarify this entangled semantic field. Contributors in this book seek to move beyond the polarizing dichotomy of rejectionist resurgence and non-transformative reconciliation to renew the collaborative search for practices of robust resurgence and transformative reconciliation in their work.<br></p></p><h2>The Gallic War (Dover Thrift Editions: History)</h2><p>The only chronicle by an ancient general of his own campaigns, this historical treasure is also a work of profound literary merit.

This great scientific breakthrough has had farreaching consequences for how we understand ourselves and our place in the natural world, and for how we might take control of our (and life's) future.<br><br><i>Life's Greatest Secret</i> mixes remarkable insights, theoretical dead-ends, and ingenious experiments with the swift pace of a thriller. From New York to Paris, Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Cambridge, England, and London to Moscow, the greatest discovery of twentieth-century biology was truly a global feat. Biologist and historian of science Matthew Cobb gives the full and rich account of the cooperation and competition between the eccentric characters mathematicians, physicists, information theorists, and biologists who contributed to this revolutionary new science. And, while every new discovery was a leap forward for science, Cobb shows how every new answer inevitably led to new questions that were at least as difficult to answer: just ask anyone who had hoped that the successful completion of the Human Genome Project was going to truly yield the book of life, or that a better understanding of epigenetics or junk DNA&#x201d; was going to be the final piece of the puzzle. But the setbacks and unexpected discoveries are what make the science exciting, and it is Matthew Cobb's telling that makes them worth reading. This is a riveting story of humans exploring what it is that makes us human and how the world works, and it is essential reading for anyone who'd like to explore those questions for themselves.</p><p><b>Matthew Cobb</b> is a professor of zoology at the University of Manchester, where he works on insects and on the history of science.

TEN WAYS TO DEVELOP STYLE</b></p><p>Think About Style</p><p>In any discussion of writing, the word <i>style </i>means the way in which an idea is expressed, not the idea itself. Style is form, not content. A reader usually picks up a story because of content but too often puts it down because of style.</p><p>There is no subject that cannot be made fascinating by a well-informed and competent writer. And there is no subject that cannot be quickly turned into a literary sleeping pill by an incompetent writer.</p><p>You probably would not buy Ray Bradbury's book <i>Dandelion Wine </i>if while browsing in&nbsp;the bookstore you turned to version&nbsp;(A). Contrast it with version (B), Bradbury's actual opening paragraph. You will see that while both paragraphs contain the same information, version (B) has style, and that makes all the difference.</p><p>(A) There wasn't any noise at 6 a.m. and nobody was up yet. The wind was about the way you'd want it, and everything was pretty much okay.

Your story might sound like the <i>Hungarian Rhapsody No.2</i>, or it might sound like "Satisfaction." You decide. But give it unity. It should not sound like a musical battle between the Cleveland Symphony Orchestra and the Rolling Stones.</p><p>Read aloud what you write and listen to its music. Listen for dissonance. Listen for the beat. Listen for gaps where the music leaps from sound to sound instead of flowing as it should. Listen for sour notes. Is this word a little sharp, is that one a bit flat? Listen for intruments that don't blend well. Is there an electric guitar shrieking amid the whispers of flutes and violins? Imagine the sound of each word as an object falling onto the eardrum. Does it make a soft landing like the word <i>ripple</i>, or does it land hard and dig in like <i>inexorable</i>? Does it cut off all sound for an instant, like <i>brutal</i>, or does it massage the reader's ear, like <i>melodious</i>?</p><p>There are no good sounds or bad sounds, just as there are no good notes or bad notes in music. It is the way in which you combine them that can make the writing succeed or fail. It's the music that matters</p><p>Mimic Spoken Language</p><p>Writing should be conversational. That does not mean that your writing should be an exact duplicate of human speech; it should not. Your writing should convey to the reader a <i>sense </i>of conversation. It should furnish the immediacy and warmth of a personal conversation.</p><p>Most real conversations, if committed to paper, would dull the senses. Conversations stumble; they stray; they repeat; they are bloated with, you know, like, meaningless words; and they are often cut short by intrusions. But what they have going for them is human contact, the sound of a human voice.</p><p>And if you put that quality into your writing, you will get the reader's attention.</p><p>So mimic spoken language in the variety of its music, in the simplicitity of its words, in the directness of its expression. But do not forfeit the enormous advantages of the written word. Writing provides time for contemplation. Use it well. In conversation the perfect word is not always there. In writing&nbsp;we can try out fifteen different words before we are satisfied. In conversation we spread our thoughts thin. In writing we can compress.</p><p>So strive to make your writing like&nbsp;conversation, but don't make it an ordinary conversation.&nbsp;Make it&nbsp;a good one.</p><p>Vary Sentence Length</p><p>This sentence has five words. Five-word sentences are fine. But several together become montonous. Listen to what is happening. The writing is getting boring. The sound of it drones. It's like a stuck record. The ear demands some variety. Now listen: I vary the sentence length, and I create music. Music. The writing sings. It has a pleasant rhythm, a lilt, a&nbsp;harmony. I use short sentences.&nbsp;I also use sentences of medium length. And sometimes when&nbsp;I am certain the reader is well rested, I will engage him with a setence of considerable length, a sentence that burns with energy and builds with all the impetus of a crescendo, the roll of the drums, the crash of the cymbals--sounds that say listen to this, it is important.</p><p>So write with a combination of short, medium, and long sentences. Create a sound that pleases the reader's ear. Don't just write words. Write music. . .</p></p><h2>Antennas And Wave Propagation, 5Th Edition</h2><p>Please Read Notes: Brand New, International Softcover Edition, Printed in black and white pages, minor self wear on the cover or pages, Sale restriction may be printed on the book, but Book name, contents, and author are exactly same as Hardcover Edition.

Its aim is to present these concepts in a clear, elementary fashion without sacrificing their profundity or exactness and to give some indication of how they are useful in increasingly more areas of mathematics. The author proceeds from the basics of set-theoretic topology, through those topological theorems and questions which are based upon the concept of the algebraic complex, to the concept of Betti groups which binds together central topological theories in a whole and upon which applications of topology largely rest.<br>Wholly consistent with current investigations, in which a larger and larger part of topology is governed by the concept of homology, the book deals primarily with the concepts of complex, cycle, and homology. It points the way toward a systematic and entirely geometrically oriented theory of the most general structures of space.<br>First English translation, prepared for Dover by Alan E. Farley.

Between the mid-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries, the food source that we still call the Irish potato had allowed the fastest population growth in the whole of Western Europe. As vividly described in � Gr�da's new work, the advent of the blight <i>phytophthora infestans</i> transformed the potato from an emblem of utility to a symbol of death by starvation. The Irish famine peaked in Black '47, but it brought misery and increased mortality to Ireland for several years.</p><br><p> Central to Irish and British history, European demography, the world history of famines, and the story of American immigration, the Great Irish Famine is presented here from a variety of new perspectives. Moving away from the traditional narrative historical approach to the catastrophe, � Gr�da concentrates instead on fresh insights available through interdisciplinary and comparative methods. He highlights several economic and sociological features of the famine previously neglected in the literature, such as the part played by traders and markets, by medical science, and by migration. Other topics include how the Irish climate, usually hospitable to the potato, exacerbated the failure of the crops in 1845-1847, and the controversial issue of Britain's failure to provide adequate relief to the dying Irish.</p><br><p> � Gr�da also examines the impact on urban Dublin of what was mainly a rural disaster and offers a critical analysis of the famine as represented in folk memory and tradition.</p><br><p> The broad scope of this book is matched by its remarkable range of sources, published and archival. The book will be the starting point for all future research into the Irish famine.</p></p><p>The Irish famine of 1847 and 1848, when harvests failed and more than 3 million Irish died or were forced to emigrate, is one of the signal events of Irish history. The famine that devastated the country, notes Cormac � Gr�da, professor of economics at University College, Dublin, was exceptional in its severity. "The cost in deaths of many highly publicized Third World famines in the recent past is modest by comparison," he writes, adding that real comparisons come only on the scale of China's catastrophic Great Leap Forward famine of 1959 to 1962 (when, Walter Becker alleges in <i>Hungry Ghosts</i>, 30 million Chinese died). The reason the Irish famine struck so hard, " Gr�da argues, is that the Irish food supply was already tenuous; dispossessed from their land and made to rely on a single crop, the potato, the tenant agriculturists of Ireland simply had no resources or stores on which to fall back.<p> Important though the famine was to Ireland's history, Gr�da notes, historians began to study it closely only in the last decade; in that time, dozens of books and monographs have been issued, amplifying a hitherto sparse literature. His scholarly book, heavily documented and full of statistics drawn from censuses and other demographic surveys, is itself a major contribution to historical writing on the subject. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><p>"� Gr�da has for a number of years been recognized as the leading economic historian of the Irish Famine. This book will immediately be seen as by far the best economic history ever published on the subject, and will remain for decades the best place to start if you want to read something about the Famine. It combines clear, sound economic reasoning with an interdisciplinary approach and an accessible writing style."<b>--Timothy W. Guinnane, Yale University</b></p><p>"This book is a gem of comparative history on the subject of the Great Irish Famine. It displays a knowledge that is at once deep and broad. The author's comparison of Ireland to other societies is particularly apposite, revealing the fact that he is not just the leading economic historian of his own country but also an expert scholar of global history."<b>--Joel Mokyr, Northwestern University</b></p></p><h2>The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man: With an Introduction by Henry Louis Gates, Jr.</h2><p>First published anonymously in 1912, this resolutely unsentimental novel gave many white readers their first glimpse of the double standard -- and double consciousness -- that ruled the lives of black people in modern America. Republished in 1927, at the height of the Harlem Renaissance, with an introduction by Carl Van Vechten, The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man became a groundbreaking document of Afro-American culture; the first first-person novel ever written by a black, it became an eloquent model for later novelists ranging from Zora Neale Hurston to Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison.<br><br>Narrated by a man whose light skin enables him to "pass" for white, the novel describes a journey through the strata of black society at the turn of the century -- from a cigar factory in Jacksonville to an elite gambling club in New York, from genteel aristocrats to the musicians who hammered out the rhythms of ragtime. The Autobiography of an Ex-Coloured Man is a complex and moving examination of the question of race and an unsparing look at what it meant to forge an identity as a man in a culture that recognized nothing but color.</p><p>With the possible exceptions of Dr. Alain Locke and W.E.B. Du Bois, no African American excelled on as many different levels as James Weldon Johnson. <i>Along This Way</i>--the first autobiography by a person of color to be reviewed in <i>The New York Times</i>--not only chronicles his life as an educator, lawyer, diplomat, newspaper editor, lyricist, poet, essayist, and political activist but also outlines the trials and triumphs of African Americans from post-Reconstruction to the rise and fall of the Harlem Renaissance. Born in Florida in 1871 to middle-class West Indian parents, Johnson recognized the challenges and absurdities of segregated America early on. But it was his experience as a tutor to rural blacks while a student at Atlanta University that was to alter the course of his life: "It was this period that marked the beginning of psychological change from boyhood to manhood," he writes. "It was this period that marked also the beginning of my knowledge of my own people as a race." <p> With a rare blend of pride and humility, Johnson recounts how he, among other accomplishments, became Florida's first black lawyer in 1898, a diplomat in Venezuela and Nicaragua, and lyricist for his brother Rosamond Johnson's famous song, "Lift Every Voice and Sing." Johnson's commentary on his epochal novel, <i>The Autobiography of an Ex-Colored Man</i>, as well as writings on his works of poetry--<i>The Creation</i>, <i>God's Trombones</i>, and <i>Fifty Years and Other Poems</i>--is priceless. Equally important are the logical and even-tempered opinions on race that he wrote for <i>The New York Age</i>, which offered comprehensive critiques of Du Bois, Booker T. Washington, and Marcus Garvey, along with his analysis of the racial climate while serving as head of the NAACP. This remarkable man left a mark on the 20th century that goes beyond the boundary of race. <i>--Eugene Holley Jr.</i></p>This book is an emotionally gripping novel of a landmark in black literary history and, more than eighty years after its original anonymous publication, a classic of American fiction. It&#39;s influenced a generation of writers during the Harlem Renaissance and served as eloquent inspiration for Zora Neale. In the 1920s and since, it has also given white readers a startling new perspective on their own culture, revealing to many the double standard of racial identity imposed on black Americans.</p><h2>Kant after Duchamp (October Books)</h2><p><p><i>Kant after Duchamp</i> brings together eight essays around a central thesis with many implications for the history of avant-gardes. Although Duchamp's ready mades broke with all previously known styles, de Duve observes that he made the logic of modernist art practice the subject matter of his work, a shift in aesthetic judgment that replaced the classical "this is beautiful" with "this is art." De Duve employs this shift (replacing the word "beauty" by the word "art") in a rereading of Kant's <i>Critique of Judgment</i> that reveals the hidden links between the radical experiments of Duchamp and the Dadaists and mainstream pictorial modernism.</p></p><p>Thierry de Duve is Director of Studies, Association de pr�figuration de l&#39;Ecole des Beaux-Arts de la Ville de Paris.<p>This is an excellent book. It is clear, careful, erudite, witty, and deep, tremendously illuminating and a pleasure to read. His command of the philosophical texts is particularly impressive. As an artist I quite naturally dismiss the question of whether something I produce is art or not as irrelevant. De Duve is the first to convince me of the importance and centrality of this question in the history of contemporary art, not only for critics and aestheticians, but for artists.</p>&#x2015;<b>Adrian Piper</b><br><br><p><i>Kant after Duchamp</i> is the very best example of the kind of multidisciplinary work that is essential to understanding our historical past and historical present. Even those art theorists and philosophers who disagree with de Duve will be moved to rethink the theoretical and historical foundations of their most cherished positions.</p>&#x2015;<b>Gregg M. Horowitz</b>, Professor of Philosophy, Vanderbilt University<br><br><p>Kantian aesthetics has long served as a legitimating force in modernism and is now the nemesis of postmodernism, but few people with de Duve's insightful grasp of art have written so intelligently about the role of Kantian aesthetic judgement in modernism and postmdoernism. De Duve's archaeological analysis is urgent and perceptive, his writing is engaging and subtle, and the results are as imaginatively argued as they are philosophically inspiring. Art historians, philosophers, critical theorists, and everyone involved in art will find this book compelling, for it is, after all, their aesthetic judgement that is at issue here.</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael Kelly</b>, Managing Editor of <i>The Journal of Philosophy</i>; Adjunct Associate Professor of Philosophy, Columbia University<br><br><p>Thierry de Duve has sought, in this remarkable text, to understand why Marcel Duchamp was such a great artist.' A task that calls upon resources beyond those of art history, art criticism, and aesthetic analysis, of all which the author is master.... The tone is wry, urbane, informed, and urgent; and it is a tribute to his appreciation of the depth of his subject that he takes us further in our understanding than we have ever seen before, but leaves us with the sense that more remains to be said than anyone before had imagined.</p>&#x2015;<b>Arthur C. Danto</b>, Johnsonian Professor Emeritus ofPhilosophy, Columbia University; and art critic, <i>The Nation</i><br><br><p>You don't have to agree with all of Thierry de Duve's premises and arguments (needless to say I don't) in order to recognize that he has written a remarkable book. The essays gathered in <i>Kant After Duchamp</i> mount the most formidable case yet made for Duchamp's importance, and what makes de Duve's achievement all the more unexpected is that this is done by way of an intense engagement with the writings of Duchamp's seeming opposite, the critic Clement Greenberg. A third constant presence in these pages is Kant's <i>Critique of Judgement</i>, which at once governs de Duve's understanding of Greenberg's 'formalism' and is itself brilliantly reinterpreted in the light of Duchamp's readymades. De Duve has always been an independent thinker. Now he has produced an indispensable book, a brilliant and learned 'archaeology' of Duchampian modernism that is also a highly original contribution to philosophical aesthetics.</p>&#x2015;<b>Michael Fried</b>, Herbert Boone Professor of Humanities, The Johns Hopkins University</p><h2>Applied Statistics in Business and Economics</h2><p><i>Applied Statistics in Business and Economics</i> provides real meaning to the use of statistics in the real world by using real business situations and real data while appealing students to know the why rather than just the how.

Expert scholars and curators identify long-lost talent and reveal how these women were formidable cultural innovators as well as agitators for the rights of artists and women during a period of extraordinary development.<br><br>Abundantly illustrated, with over one-hundred color plates, this book is a rich compendium of Western art by women, including those of Native American, African, Mexican, and Asian descent. The essays examine the many economic, social, and political forces that shaped this art over years of pivotal change. The West's dynamic growth altered the role of women, often allowing new avenues of opportunity within the prevailing Anglo culture. At the same time, boundaries of femininity were pushed earlier and further than in other parts of the country.<br><br>Women artists in the West painted a wide range of subjects, and their work embraced a variety of styles: Realism, Impressionism, Symbolism, Surrealism. Some women championed modern art as gallery owners, collectors, and critics, while others were educators and curators. All played an important role in gaining the acceptance of women as men's peers in artistic communities, and their independent spirit resonates in studios and galleries throughout the country today.</p><p>"The history of women's participation in the westward expansion has often been subsumed into myths of pioneers and cowgirls. <i>Independent Spirits</i> offers convincing evidence of real women's contributions to the cultural life of the American West. Many of the names may be unfamiliar, but the stories can't help but transform our idea of history. An accessible and informative volume."&#x2015;Whitney Chadwick, Professor of Art History, San Francisco State University<br><br>"<i>Independent Spirits</i> offers the first step in documenting the achievements and innovations of women in the pictorial arts. The history of Western American painting can never again be examined without the consideration of women in that development."&#x2015;William Gerdts, Professor of Art History, The Graduate School and University Center of the City University of New York<br><br>"This book makes available the material we need to begin rethinking the West's cultural history. The art history of the region&#x2015;like the general histories of the West itself&#x2015;has long concentrated on the work of men. With tightly focused regional essays, fresh photographic illustrations, and reproductions of many little-known works of art, this book establishes women as central figures in the creation of American art."&#x2015;Martha Sandweiss, Director of the Mead Art Museum, Amherst College<br><br>"At last there is for art of the American West a serious diversion from the enduring continuum of male-oriented surveys. In this handsome volume, for the first time, women's art is copiously revealed and duly celebrated. Their persistent and remarkable creative forces have played a powerful part in interpreting Western life and evolving regional tastes.

He then traces the evolution of their classical religious styles which, with disparate settings and unique histories, produced strikingly different spiritual climates. So in Morocco, the Islamic conception of life came to mean activism, moralism, and intense individuality, while in Indonesia the same concept emphasized aestheticism, inwardness, and the radical dissolution of personality.

Are they literally true or false, or do they lack truth values altogether? Addressing questions that have attracted lively debate in recent years, Stewart Shapiro contends that standard realist and antirealist accounts of mathematics are both problematic.<br><br> As Benacerraf first noted, we are confronted with the following powerful dilemma. The desired continuity between mathematical and, say, scientific language suggests realism, but realism in this context suggests seemingly intractable epistemic problems. As a way out of this dilemma, Shapiro articulates a structuralist approach. On this view, the subject matter of arithmetic, for example, is not a fixed domain of numbers independent of each other, but rather is the natural number structure, the pattern common to any system of objects that has an initial object and successor relation satisfying the induction principle. Using this framework, realism in mathematics can be preserved without troublesome epistemic consequences.<br><br> Shapiro concludes by showing how a structuralist approach can be applied to wider philosophical questions such as the nature of an "object" and the Quinean nature of ontological commitment. Clear, compelling, and tautly argued, Shapiro's work, noteworthy both in its attempt to develop a full-length structuralist approach to mathematics and to trace its emergence in the history of mathematics, will be of deep interest to both philosophers and mathematicians.<br></p><p><br><strong>Stewart Shapiro</strong> is Professor of Philosophy at Ohio State University at Newark and the University of St. Andrews, Scotland.<br>"This book is an important contribution...presenting an original, structuralist philosophy and axiomatic framework in comprehensive detail, placing it in broad philosophical and historical perspective, and comparing it systematically with other approaches seen as leading structuralist alternatives<br>to the one set forth by Shapiro himself....this is an interesting, important, and thought-provoking book."--Journal of Symbolic Logic<br> "This book is an important contribution...presenting an original, structuralist philosophy and axiomatic framework in comprehensive detail, placing it in broad philosophical and historical perspective, and comparing it systematically with other approaches seen as leading structuralist alternatives <br> to the one set forth by Shapiro himself....this is an interesting, important, and thought-provoking book."--Journal of Symbolic Logic<br>"This book is an important contribution...presenting an original, structuralist philosophy and axiomatic framework in comprehensive detail, placing it in broad philosophical and historical perspective, and comparing it systematically with other approaches seen as leading structuralist alternatives to the one set forth by Shapiro himself....this is an interesting, important, and thought-provoking book."--Journal of Symbolic Logic<br>"This book is an important contribution...presenting an original, structuralist philosophy and axiomatic framework in comprehensive detail, placing it in broad philosophical and historical perspective, and comparing it systematically with other approaches seen as leading structuralist alternatives to the one set forth by Shapiro himself....this is an interesting, important, and thought-provoking book."--Journal of Symbolic Logic<p><br></p></p><h2>Data Networks (2nd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> Based on an extremely popular short course conducted by the authors for several Fortune 500 companies, this volume is designed to help professionals develop a deeper understanding of data networks and evolving integrated networks, and to explore today's various analysis and design tools. <b>KEY TOPICS:</b> It begins with an overview of the principles behind data networks, then develops an understanding of the modeling issues and mathematical analysis needed to compare the effectiveness of different networks. <b> </b> An ideal reference for Communication, Network, and Research and Development Engineers. </p></p><p>An exploration of data networks, evolving integrated networks, and the various analysis and design tools.</p><h2>Jay DeFeo: A Retrospective</h2><p><p>Jay DeFeo (1929&#x2013;1989) was part of a vibrant community of avant-garde artists, poets, and musicians in San Francisco during the 1950s and 1960s. Her circle included Wallace Berman, Joan Brown, Bruce Conner, Wally Hedrick, Edward Kienholz, and Michael McClure. Although best known for her monumental painting <i>The Rose</i> (1958&#x2013;66), DeFeo worked in a wide range of media and produced an astoundingly diverse and compelling body of work over four decades.

With beautifully detailed, realistic paintings, noted wildlife illustrator John Sill introduces readers to many varieties of raptors, from the majestic Bald Eagle of North America to the sharp-eyed Secretary Bird of Africa.

She lives in North Carolina.K-Gr 2&#x2013;This book comes as a boon to young audiences. One short, clearly written sentence or phrase per page communicates the basics about raptors: who they are, where they live, what they eat, and how they hunt. Their similarities, such as strong feet with sharp claws, and their differences, such as locations and kinds of nests, communicate diversity in raptors throughout the world. Eighteen quality watercolors focus on the birds in their natural habitats. Then in an afterword, all of the illustrations are included in miniature with a short paragraph expanding upon the original topics introduced in the text. These deeper explanations reveal more details: "Some raptors that raise their chicks on cliffs and ledges do not build a nest. They scrape out a place in the dirt and gravel to lay their eggs." This book is a must-buy for all libraries interested in building a strong natural-science collection for their young patrons.<i>Nancy Call, Santa Cruz Public Libraries, Aptos, CA</i><br>� Copyright 2010.

On the one hand intellectual historians commonly accuse philosophers of writing bad - anachronistic - history of philosophy, and on the other, philosophers have accused intellectual historians of writing bad - antiquarian - history of philosophy. The essays here address this controversy and ask what purpose the history of philosophy should serve. Part I contains more purely theoretical and methodological discussion, of such questions as whether there are &#39;timeless&#39; philosophical problems, whether the issues of one epoch are commensurable with those of another, and what style is appropriate to the historiography of the subject. The essays in Part II consider a number of case-histories. They present important revisionist scholarship and original contributions on topics drawn from ancient, early modern and more recent philosophy. All the essays have been specially commissioned, and the contributors include many of the leading figures in the field. The volume as a whole will be of vital interest to everyone concerned with the study of philosophy and of its history.</p><p>Sixteen essays confront the current debate about the relationship between philosophy and its history.

They were looking for photographs that were made and used as transparent documents and purely objective instruments--as evidence, in short. Selecting 50 of the best, they printed these images with the care you would expect to find in a high-quality art photography book, publishing them in a simple, limited-edition volume titled <i>Evidence</i>. The concept for the book was clear: select photographs intended to be used as objective evidence and show that it is never that simple. Now an undisputed classic in the photo world, considered a seminal harbinger of conceptual photography, <i>Evidence</i> is nearly impossible to find. This new edition is being published in recognition of the project's continued relevance, and will contain a facsimile copy of the original book plus a newly commissioned scholarly essay by Sandra Phillips of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. Additionally, this edition will include a new spread of images and a group of black-and-white illustrations selected by the artists from an archive of photographs that were not included in the original book.</p><p>Larry Sultan and Mike Mandel&#x2019;s enormously influential 1977 volume of found institutional photographs... -- <i>Flash Art</i></p><h2>The Death and Life of Monterey Bay: A Story of Revival</h2><p>Anyone who has ever stood on the shores of Monterey Bay, watching the rolling ocean waves and frolicking otters, knows it is a unique place. But even residents on this idyllic California coast may not realize its full history. Monterey began as a natural paradise, but became the poster child for industrial devastation in John Steinbeck&#x2019;s Cannery Row,and is now one of the most celebrated shorelines in the world.<br> &nbsp;<br> It is a remarkable story of life, death, and revival&#x2014;told here for the first time in all its stunning color and bleak grays. The Death and Life of Monterey Bay begins in the eighteenth century when Spanish and French explorers encountered a rocky shoreline brimming with life&#x2014;raucous sea birds, abundant sea otters, barking sea lions, halibut the size of wagon wheels,waters thick with whales. A century and a half later, many of the sea creatures had disappeared, replaced by sardine canneries that sickened residents with their stench but kept the money flowing. When the fish ran out and the climate turned,the factories emptied and the community crumbled. But today,both Monterey&#x2019;s economy and wildlife are resplendent. How did it happen?<br> &nbsp;<br> The answer is deceptively simple: through the extraordinary acts of ordinary people. The Death and Life of Monterey Bay is the biography of a place, but also of the residents who reclaimed it. Monterey is thriving because of an eccentric mayor who wasn&#x2019;t afraid to use pistols, axes, or the force of law to protect her coasts. It is because of fishermen who love their livelihood, scientists who are fascinated by the sea&#x2019;s mysteries, and philanthropists and community leaders willing to invest in a world-class aquarium. The shores of Monterey Bay revived because of human passion&#x2014;passion that enlivens every page of this hopeful book.</p><p>Stephen R. Palumbi is the Director of the Hopkins Marine Station and the Jane and Marshall Steele Jr. Professor of Marine Science at Stanford University. Carolyn Sotka manages science and policy outreach activities for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration&#x2019;s Oceans and Human Health Initiative."[A] colorful history of times long gone, of environments degraded, of an intricate web of life threatened&#x2014;and how it has finally begun to recover through the hopeful work of communities and their leaders...[A] fascinating book, filled with anecdote and history, they explore the complex environment of the region, its fabulous sea life, and its colorful cast of humans." (<i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i>)<br><br>"In this buoyant history of Monterey Bay, it's the humans, not the ocean life, that take center stage... the happy ending, so rare in nature literature nowadays, is refreshing." (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"Palumbi and Sotka bring to life a rich cast of characters from five centuries to tell the story of Monterey Bay's discovery, destruction, and redemption. A marvellous tale, beautifully told." (Callum Roberts <i>Professor, University of York and author of The Unnatural History of the Sea</i>)<br><br>"In a world of too many problems and too few solutions, Monterey Bay, California bucks the trend. It's better now than a century ago, and the vision of what can happen when stubborn people set their minds to something makes this a story not just of a great place, but of inspiration that can work in many places." (Carl Safina <i>author of Song for the Blue Ocean and The View From Lazy Point</i>)<br><br>"Just as the Monterey Bay Aquarium now exhibits the wonders of marine life in the unique environment of Monterey Bay, Palumbi and Sotka turn back the pages of time to illuminate the fall and rise of the sea otter population; the lives of the local squid and abalones; the men and women who lived and worked there; the whales that came (and still come) to visit; the collapse of the sardine canneries; and how the dilapidated Hovden cannery was transformed into the best aquarium in America."

Amongst the dozens of illustrated editions of <i>Alice</i> published over the years, Harry Rountree's contribution may be the most remarkable. Luxuriously illustrated with 92 watercolors, many of which are full page, with the others carefully placed with textual wraparound, this is a marvelous evocation of Carroll's madcap world. Rountree's career as an illustrator was short lived, but this, along with his <i>Aesop's Fables,</i> are acknowledged masterpieces. The enduring popularity of all things Alice makes this both a timely and timeless Calla publication.</p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense. <p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story. (All ages) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>Lewis Carroll's <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> has continuously delighted readers, young and old, for more than a century. This classic tale, interpreted by many outstanding artists over the years, is a remarkable story of one little girl who embarks on possibly one of the most amazing adventures in literary history. In this stunning special edition, Helen Oxenbury turns her hand to what is certainly no small project and has succeeded in surpassing expectation. More abundantly illustrated than other editions of the same work, this unabridged version is packed with contemporary and accessible interpretations of the kaleidoscope of characters--the White Rabbit, the Mad Hatter, the Cheshire Cat, the Queen of Hearts--who have each captured the imaginations of generations of children. Alice herself is portrayed as a thoroughly modern miss--casually dressed, personable, and spirited--and her surroundings are brought to effervescent life with a warmth, depth, and distinctive sense of humor that perfectly complement the shenanigans of the topsy-turvy world of Wonderland.

High levels of stress and big emotions related to social situations, sensory issues, or general frustration are common in children who live with anxiety. Such stress can lead to a loss of control, resulting in aggressive behavior, such as screaming, throwing things or even hurting someone. Prolonged anxiety can also seriously impact success in academic achievement and cause children to avoid social and extracurricular activities. Now with a special section on evidence-based teaching activities for parents and teachers alike, this bestselling children s classic just became even better and more relevant. Engaging and easy to read, this illustrated children s book is filled with opportunities for children to participate in developing their own self-calming strategies.

Written by an active member of the open source community, the book is structured to gradually introduce readers to the intricacies of embedded Linux, with detailed information and examples in each chapter that culminate in describing how Linux is actually put on an embedded device.</p><p><p>Karim Yaghmour is the founder and president of Opersys Inc. (http://www.opersys.com), a company providing expertise and courses on the use of open source and free software in embedded systems. Being himself an active member of the open source and free software community, Karim has firmly established Opersys's services around the core values of knowledge sharing and technical quality promoted by this community. As part of his community involvement, Karim is the maintainer of the Linux Trace Toolkit and the author of a series of white-papers that led to the implementation of the Adeos nanokernel, which allows multiple operating systems to exist side-by-side. Karim's quest for understanding how things work started at a very young age when he took it upon himself to break open all the radios and cassette players he could lay his hands on in order to "fix" them. Very early, he developed a keen interest in operating system internals and embedded systems. He now holds a B.Eng. and an M.A.Sc. from the cole Polytechnique de Montral. While everyone was hacking away at Linux, Karim even took a detour to write his own distributed micro-kernel in order to get to the bottom of operating system design and implementation. When not working on software, Karim indulges in his passion for history, philosophy, sociology, and humanities in general.

Art historians also have considered illuminated manuscripts as important repositories for works of art. But in recent decades new interest has developed in the over-all physical format of the medieval book and its historical context &#x2013; how manuscript books were made and how they have deepened our understanding of the intellectual and social milieu of the Middle Ages and Renaissance.</p><p>One of the richest storehouses of early manuscripts is Yale University&#x2019;s Beinecke Library.

From East to West, generations of readers have marveled at its mystical yet simple profundity. It is considered to be the single most important text of Taoism. However, the question of how exactly it should be classified does not admit of a clear answer. Is the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> a book of ethics? Is it a religious text? Is it philosophical, especially given its focus on the deepest and truest way of seeing reality? Or is it, in fact, a work of literary genius&#x2014;playful, poetic, paradoxical? No doubt the text has aspects of each and can be enjoyed for its poetry no less than for its reflections on human affairs, life, the universe, and the nature of the good. Nevertheless, one might wonder if there is an essential message to the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> and whether, as a consequence, there is a genre to which this message belongs. </p><p>Many have called it a book of wisdom, part of the so-called &#x201c;wisdom tradition&#x201d; that predates any single religion and that finds expression in texts as disparate as the <i>Bhagavad Gita</i>, the Socratic dialogues, and the biblical book of Proverbs. These works typically extol the study of both virtue and the obstacles to virtue; they attempt to reveal the path to right relations between humans, and to right relations between humans and the universe. Like the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, these texts often focus on two primary methods by which one can acquire a deeper knowledge of virtue: gaining self-knowledge and rejecting worldly aims and standards. However, if the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> is to be thought of as a book of wisdom, what sense can be made of its attacks on wisdom and virtue? &#x201c;Get rid of &#x2018;holiness&#x2019; and abandon &#x2018;wisdom&#x2019; and the people will benefit a hundredfold,&#x201d; it proclaims (chapter 19). And in another passage, on the incommensurability of the Tao and virtue, we are told: &#x201c;True virtue is not virtuous / Therefore it has virtue. / Superficial virtue never fails to be virtuous / Therefore it has no virtue&#x201d; (chapter 38). </p><p>Upon encountering passages such as these, even the most dedicated reader may feel a temptation to reinterpret or simplify away the ensuing confusion. However, before dismissing these paradoxes as senseless, or relegating them to the level of mere word play, we must go back to the beginning&#x2014;the beginning of the text, that is. There we are told, &#x201c;The Tao that can be followed is not the eternal Tao. / The name that can be named is not the eternal name&#x201d; (chapter 1). The internal resistance of the text itself to categorization, especially as a work that attempts to teach the nature of virtue in a way that can be &#x201c;named&#x201d; or &#x201c;followed,&#x201d; is no accident. </p><p>As with most texts that are as ancient as the <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, there remains some controversy over both the historical dating of the work and the biographical details of its author, Lao Tzu. The traditional view dates the text back to the sixth century B.C., largely on the basis of accounts describing a meeting between Confucius and Lao Tzu. These accounts describe Lao Tzu as an older man who is a contemporary of the younger Confucius (551&#x2013;479 B.C.). However, reports of the supposed meeting were not accepted as tradition until the middle of the third century B.C., thus rendering their authority somewhat doubtful. Most modern scholars agree that the <i>Tao Te Ching</i> emerged in the late fourth century or early third century, about 2,500 years ago. In fact, stone tablets dated to around 300 B.C. have been found engraved with recognizable fragments of the text. Such a date would place the writing of the text at the height of one of the most intellectually productive times in Chinese history, known as the &#x201c;Hundred Schools of Thought.&#x201d; During this time a multitude of philosophies were developed and a rich culture of intellectual debate flourished. Besides Taoism, other schools such as Confucianism, Legalism, and Mohism gave rise to the central classical texts that were to exert a great influence on Chinese thought over the next two millennia. </p><p>The name &#x201c;Lao Tzu&#x201d; was not the personal name of the author, but one bestowed upon him out of respect: &#x201c;Lao&#x201d; means &#x201c;old&#x201d; or &#x201c;venerable,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Tzu&#x201d; is an honorific term attached to the names of scholars that can be roughly translated as &#x201c;master.&#x201d; Very little was recorded about the actual life of Lao Tzu, and consequently there is much disagreement regarding his historical existence. Although he is mentioned on scrolls dating as far back as 400 B.C., many have attributed this appearance in the historical record to mere legend. Indeed, the legends surrounding the life of Lao Tzu are truly fantastic. The historian Ssu-ma Ch&#x2019;ien, author of the <i>Shih chi</i> (<i>Records of the Historian</i>), reports claims that Lao Tzu lived to more than two hundred years of age! Other legends maintain that he was born with white hair. According to Taoist tradition, he was an archivist who worked in the imperial library of the Zhou Dynasty court. It was there that he supposedly met Confucius, who had come to inquire about propriety and rites. Lao Tzu proceeded to dazzle him with his deep insight into the meaninglessness of these basic tenets of Confucian morality. According to this same story, Lao Tzu later resigned from his post in the Zhou court, then traveled west on a water buffalo to reach the great desert. He was stopped by a guard at the westernmost gate. This guard demanded that Lao Tzu&#x2014;who had never, until this point, written down a word of his teachings&#x2014;leave a record of his wisdom before he departed forever into the desert.

With characteristic civility and sophistication, the author welcomes us into her fictional stretch of English countryside, a magical landscape spirited with good people going about the business of life, irresistibly entertaining in their determination to misunderstand each other. In this case, the charming round of infatuations, endearments, and delightfully comic cross-purposes is set spinning by Fanny Turner whose favorite pastime is endeavoring to provide "a succession of possible brides" for her husband's former school friend, the charming, if not especially eligible, Valentine Ensor. Fanny's exuberant, misguided attempts at matchmaking produce a dizzying tangle of romantic mishaps when holiday guests show up with an attractive--and very married--daughter in tow. Thirkell's stylish prose and generous, yet acutely observant comedy offers a feast of reading that is cultivated, nourishing, refreshing and restorative. Moyer Bell is pleased to add <i><b>Ankle Deep</b></i> to its continuing series of Angela Thirkell books.Angela Thirkell was born in London in 1890. Mrs. Thirkell did not begin writing novels until her return to Britain in 1930; then, for the rest of her life, she produced a new book almost every year until her death in 1961.</p><h2>Tales from the Kathasaritsagara</h2><p>The original Kathasaritasagara or ocean of the streams of stories , is a collection of over 22,000 shlokas, taken from 18 books and 124 chapters, composed into verses.

When the wealthy and very eligible bachelor Charles Bingley purchases an estate in the Bennets' small town, he and the beautiful Jane immediately fall in love. But Bingley's arrogant friend Darcy just as quickly alienates Lizzy when she overhears him speaking dismissively of her. These first impressions have lasting repercussions for Jane, Elizabeth, and their whole family.&nbsp;Rich in wit and wisdom, humor and humanity, <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> takes a probing, entertaining look at the nature of love, money, and power in Georgian England.</p><p><i>"It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."</i><p> Next to the exhortation at the beginning of <i>Moby-Dick</i>, "Call me Ishmael," the first sentence of Jane Austen's <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> must be among the most quoted in literature. And certainly what Melville did for whaling Austen does for marriage--tracing the intricacies (not to mention the economics) of 19th-century British mating rituals with a sure hand and an unblinking eye. As usual, Austen trains her sights on a country village and a few families--in this case, the Bennets, the Philips, and the Lucases. Into their midst comes Mr. Bingley, a single man of good fortune, and his friend, Mr. Darcy, who is even richer. Mrs. Bennet, who married above her station, sees their arrival as an opportunity to marry off at least one of her five daughters. Bingley is complaisant and easily charmed by the eldest Bennet girl, Jane; Darcy, however, is harder to please. Put off by Mrs. Bennet's vulgarity and the untoward behavior of the three younger daughters, he is unable to see the true worth of the older girls, Jane and Elizabeth. His excessive pride offends Lizzy, who is more than willing to believe the worst that other people have to say of him; when George Wickham, a soldier stationed in the village, does indeed have a discreditable tale to tell, his words fall on fertile ground. </p><p> Having set up the central misunderstanding of the novel, Austen then brings in her cast of fascinating secondary characters: Mr. Collins, the sycophantic clergyman who aspires to Lizzy's hand but settles for her best friend, Charlotte, instead; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Darcy's insufferably snobbish aunt; and the Gardiners, Jane and Elizabeth's low-born but noble-hearted aunt and uncle. Some of Austen's best comedy comes from mixing and matching these representatives of different classes and economic strata, demonstrating the hypocrisy at the heart of so many social interactions. And though the novel is rife with romantic misunderstandings, rejected proposals, disastrous elopements, and a requisite happy ending for those who deserve one, Austen never gets so carried away with the romance that she loses sight of the hard economic realities of 19th-century matrimonial maneuvering. Good marriages for penniless girls such as the Bennets are hard to come by, and even Lizzy, who comes to sincerely value Mr. Darcy, remarks when asked when she first began to love him: "It has been coming on so gradually, that I hardly know when it began. But I believe I must date it from my first seeing his beautiful grounds at Pemberley." She may be joking, but there's more than a little truth to her sentiment, as well. Jane Austen considered Elizabeth Bennet "as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print". Readers of <i>Pride and Prejudice</i> would be hard-pressed to disagree. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

In this witty tragedy of treachery, self-deception, and betrayal, Henry James weaves together three ill-fated and wholly human destinies unexpectedly linked by desire, greed, and salvation. As Amy Bloom writes in her Introduction, &#x201c;<b>The Wings of the Dove</b> is a novel of intimacy. . . . [James] gives us passion, he gives us love in its terrible and enchanting forms.&#x201d;</p><p><i>The Wings of the Dove</i> is a classic example of Henry James's morality tales that play off the naivet� of an American protagonist abroad. In early-20th-century London, Kate Croy and Merton Densher are engaged in a passionate, clandestine love affair. Croy is desperately in love with Densher, who has all the qualities of a potentially excellent husband: he's handsome, witty, and idealistic--the one thing he lacks is money, which ultimately renders him unsuitable as a mate. By chance, Croy befriends a young American heiress, Milly Theale. When Croy discovers that Theale suffers from a mysterious and fatal malady, she hatches a plan that can give all three characters something that they want--at a price. Croy and Densher plan to accompany the young woman to Venice where Densher, according to Croy's design, will seduce the ailing heiress. The two hope that Theale will find love and happiness in her last days and--when she dies--will leave her fortune to Densher, so that he and Croy can live happily ever after. The scheme that at first develops as planned begins to founder when Theale discovers the pair's true motives shortly before her death. Densher struggles with unanticipated feelings of love for his new paramour, and his guilt may obstruct his ability to avail himself of Theale's gift. James deftly navigates the complexities and irony of such moral treachery in this stirring novel.Founded in 1906 by J.M.

Long dissatisfied with the moral theories of her contemporaries, she has gradually evolved a theory of her own that is radically opposed not only to emotivism and prescriptivism but also to the whole subjectivist, anti-naturalist movement deriving from David Hume. Dissatisfied with both Kantian and utilitarian ethics, she claims to have isolated a special form of evaluation that predicates goodness and defect only to living things considered as such; she finds this form of evaluation in moral judgements. Her vivid discussion covers topics such as practical rationality, erring conscience, and the relation between virtue and happiness, ending with a critique of Nietzsche&#39;s immoralism. This long-awaited book exposes a highly original approach to moral philosophy and represents a fundamental break from the assumptions of recent debates. Foot challenges many prominent philosophical arguments and attitudes; but hers is a work full of life and feeling, written for anyone intrigued by the deepest questions about goodness and human.</p><p><br>Philippa Foot is Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at the University of California, Los Angeles, Honourary Fellow of Somerville College, Oxford, and a Fellow of the British Academy.<br><br>"<em>Natural Goodness</em> is an exciting and provoking book, more interesting than most books in moral philosophy....What she has given us both in this book and elsewhere deserves nothing but intellectual and moral gratitude."-- Alasdair MacIntyre, <em>Philosophical Quarterly</em><p></p><br>"One of the most fascinating ideas in ancient philosophy--that there is a close relation between human happiness and virtue--has been largely neglected in modern philosophy. In this highly significant book, Philippa Foot revives that idea, rooting it in an understanding of human goodness as depending on the nature of our species. In more than one sense, it is a work of great integrity. Beautifully and economically written, and powerfully argued, it will become a classic of modern moral philosophy."--Roger Crisp<p></p><br>"A lovely, profound, and remarkably agile work"--<em>Virginia Quarterly Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>How Biblical Languages Work: A Student&#39;s Guide to Learning Hebrew and Greek</h2><p>A practical and easy-to-understand guide to the logical structure of both Hebrew and Greek.

This now-classic text has continued to provide general guidelines for individual and family clothing choices through its five previous editions. It has been a major text for four decades by providing a broad base of knowledge at an introductory level for the general education of students&#x2014;a task ignored by most clothing texts, which typically have either a more narrow, in-depth focus or target the more advanced student. <i>Individuality</i> is unique in that it meets the needs of the student who is interested in taking a single course in fashion as well as the student who aspires to become a fashion professional. </p> <p><b>Focus</b></p> <p> In this sixth edition, <i>Individuality</i> continues its tradition of providing a concise overview of fashion as it relates to the individual consumer. The primary aim of the authors is to offer students a basic overview of the various influences on individual thought processes regarding clothing preferences, how clothing is uniquely designed for specific target groups, and how clothing purchase choices are made. </p> <p><b>Conceptualization and Update</b></p> <p> In order to accomplish the challenge of providing students with the latest information in an organized and compelling format, the authors have divided the text into three sections. The basic organization of the text has remained essentially the same with the exception of Part I, in which the chapters were rearranged to begin with a macro view of consumers. Chapter 1, retitled Target Market Influences, is a discussion of the demographic breakdown of U.S. consumer groups and their responsiveness to fashion. It also discusses the impact of Generation Y (tweens and teens) on the fashion industry. Chapter 2 gives a brief overview of the fashion industry, specifically focusing on basic terminology, past and current influential designers, and theories of fashion movement. Chapter 3 covers the influences of an individual's culture on clothing and shows how diaspora has created an international fashion concept. Chapter 4, the sociopsychological influences on fashion, has few changes. Chapter 5 shows the physical influences of fashion with emphasis on the continuation of two conflicting trends: the idealization of the overly thin body and the dominance of processed foods in the U.S. diet. </p> <p> Part II examines the design elements and principles as applied to clothing. The reader is given definitions of line, shape, color, and texture and then shown how each is applied to fashion items. This explanation of design elements is followed by a discussion of how these elements are organized by emphasis, rhythm, unity, proportion, and balance by designers who create fabrics and fashion. </p> <p> Part III focuses on clothing selection issues facing consumers. Chapter 11 discusses the fit requirements of individuals in various age groups. This is followed by a discussion of clothing quality and its impact on price in Chapter 12. Chapter 13 updates previous editions' discussion of consumer clothing care including new methods of dry cleaning and care for new fibers. Chapter 14 specifically relates to wardrobe selection, emphasizing industry trends for careerwear such as the beginning of a movement in some companies back to a more traditional look for business apparel. Chapter 15 ends the book with a discussion of the retail environment of traditional bricks and mortar stores compared to the trend toward e-tailing&#x2014;bricks &amp; clicks. </p> <p> In general, the content of each chapter has been updated with new data and photographs. Activities have been updated to reflect fashion in the twenty-first century. An emphasis on fashion and the web has been added with a large number of web addresses provided for student usage. </p> <p><b>New Features</b></p> <p> Several features were added in the fifth edition and updated in the sixth edition to reinforce important concepts to the reader: </p> <ul> <li>A <i>model</i> introduces each of the three parts and illustrates the topics of that part's five chapters. The model is also featured on the first page of each new chapter to remind the reader of interrelationship of this chapter to the whole part.</li> <li><i>Objectives</i> open each chapter. </li><li><i>Definitions</i> are boxed to increase visibility.</li> <li><i>Activities</i> that involve students in applying their new knowledge appear throughout the text rather than at the chapter's end.</li> <li><i>A summary</i> of key information ends each chapter.</li> <li><i>Case studies</i> appear in several chapters.</li> <li><i>Charts,</i> figures, and tables consolidate large portions of information.</li> <li><i>Key words and concepts</i> are given for the student to review at the end of each chapter.</li> </ul> <p> The authors hope that we have been able to convey the excitement and fun of the dynamic world of fashion. Whether a student is entertaining the idea of a career in fashion or is interested personally in fashion, we hope that <i>Individuality</i> has introduced the concepts, theories, and pragmatic application of this challenging, ever changing, and never dull field. </p></p><h2>Complete Spanish All-in-One (Practice Makes Perfect) (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p><b>Get five times the language-learning expertise for the price of one book!</b></p> More than a million students have turned to the Practice Makes Perfect series for a trusted guide to help build their language-learning skills.

As in&nbsp;<i>The Scarlet Letter</i>, Hawthorne is concerned here with the nature of transgression and guilt. A murder, motivated by love, affects not only Donatello, the murderer, but his beloved Miriam and their friends Hilda and Kenyon. As he explores the reactions of each to the crime, Hawthorne dramatizes both the freedoms a new cultural model inspires and the self-censoring conformities it requires. His examination of the influence of European culture on American travellers lay the groundwork for such later works of American fiction as Mark Twain's&nbsp;<i>The Innocents Abroad</i>&nbsp;and Henry James'<i>&nbsp;The Portrait of a Lady</i>.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price.

Scott Fitzgerald, and Ernest Hemingway, among others. The story of the mysterious, tormented Miriam, her friends Kenyon and Hilda, their alluring Italian acquaintance, the faunlike Donatello, and the crime that irrevocably links them all is, says Peter Robb, ?a surprising drama, one that recalls nothing so much as American noir of a hundred years later . . . driven by the powerful and unfaltering engines of sex and violence.?<br><br>This Modern Library Paperback Classic uses the definitive text as prepared for <i>The Centenary Edition of the Works of Nathaniel Hawthorne</i>.</p><h2>Multimedia Learning</h2><p>For hundreds of years verbal messages such as lectures and printed lessons have been the primary means of explaining ideas to learners. Although verbal learning offers a powerful tool, this book explores ways of going beyond the purely verbal. Recent advances in graphics technology and information technology have prompted new efforts to understand the potential of multimedia learning as a means of promoting human understanding. In Multimedia Learning, Second Edition, Richard E. Mayer examines whether people learn more deeply when ideas are expressed in words and pictures rather than in words alone. He reviews 12 principles of instructional design that are based on experimental research studies and grounded in a theory of how people learn from words and pictures. The result is what Mayer calls the cognitive theory of multimedia learning, a theory first developed in the first edition of Multimedia Learning and further developed in The Cambridge Handbook of Multimedia Learning.</p><p>Richard E.

What role does truth play in our lives? What do we lose if we reject truthfulness? No philosopher is better suited to answer these questions than Bernard Williams. Writing with his characteristic combination of passion and elegant simplicity, he explores the value of truth and finds it to be both less and more than we might imagine.</p><br><p> Modern culture exhibits two attitudes toward truth: suspicion of being deceived (no one wants to be fooled) and skepticism that objective truth exists at all (no one wants to be naive). This tension between a demand for truthfulness and the doubt that there is any truth to be found is not an abstract paradox. It has political consequences and signals a danger that our intellectual activities, particularly in the humanities, may tear themselves to pieces.</p><br><p> Williams's approach, in the tradition of Nietzsche's genealogy, blends philosophy, history, and a fictional account of how the human concern with truth might have arisen. Without denying that we should worry about the contingency of much that we take for granted, he defends truth as an intellectual objective and a cultural value. He identifies two basic virtues of truth, Accuracy and Sincerity, the first of which aims at finding out the truth and the second at telling it. He describes different psychological and social forms that these virtues have taken and asks what ideas can make best sense of them today.</p><br><br><p> <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> presents a powerful challenge to the fashionable belief that truth has no value, but equally to the traditional faith that its value guarantees itself. Bernard Williams shows us that when we lose a sense of the value of truth, we lose a lot both politically and personally, and may well lose everything.</p></p><p><p>"In this exceptionally brilliant book, ranging effortlessly from Herodotus and Thucydides to Diderot and Nietzsche, Bernard Williams daringly asks--and still more daringly answers--one of the central questions of philosophy: what is the point of telling the truth? Lucid, penetrating, and profound, Williams' reflections are vitally important not for philosophers alone but for anyone interested in human thought and creativity."<b>--Stephen Greenblatt, Cogan University Professor of the Humanities, Harvard University</b></p><p>"This is a major, wide-ranging, and comprehensive book. A philosophical investigation that is also a literary and historical study, <i>Truth and Truthfulness</i> asks how and why we have come to think of accuracy, sincerity, and authenticity as virtues. Bernard Williams' account of their emergence is as detailed and imaginative as his defense of their importance is spirited and provocative. Williams asks hard questions, and gives them straightforward and controversial answers. His book does not simply describe and advocate these virtues of truthfulness; it manifests them."<b>--Alexander Nehamas, author of <i>Virtues of Authenticity</i></b></p><b>Bernard Williams</b> was Knightbridge Professor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge (1967-1979) and Provost of King's College. He held the Monroe Deutsch Professorship of Philosophy at the University of California, Berkeley (1998-2000) and was White's Professor of Moral Philosophy at the University of Oxford (1990-2003). He was Fellow of All Souls College, Oxford until his death in 2003.</p><h2>Working Conditions: The Writings of Hans Haacke (Writing Art)</h2><p><p><b>Texts by Hans Haacke that range from straightforward descriptions of his artworks to wide-ranging reflections on the relationship between art and politics.</b></p><p>Hans Haacke's art articulates the interdependence of multiple elements. An artwork is not merely an object but is also its context&#x2015;the economic, social, and political conditions of the art world and the world at large. Among his best-known works are <i>MoMA-Poll</i> (1970), which polled museumgoers on their opinions about Nelson Rockefeller and the Nixon administration's Indochina policy; <i>Gallery-Goers' Birthplace and Residence Profile </i>(1969), which canvassed visitors to the Howard Wise Gallery in Manhattan; and the famously canceled 1971 solo exhibition at the Guggenheim Museum, which was meant to display, among other things, works on two New York real estate empires.</p><p>This volume collects writings by Haacke that explain and document his practice. The texts, some of which have never before been published, run from straightforward descriptions to wide-ranging reflections and full-throated polemics. They include correspondence with MoMA and the Guggenheim and a letter refusing to represent the United States at the 1969 S�o Paulo Biennial; the title piece, &#x201c;Working Conditions,&#x201d; which discusses corporate influence on the art world; Haacke's thinking about &#x201c;real-time social systems&#x201d;; and texts written for museum catalogs on various artworks, including <i>GERMANIA</i>, in the German Pavilion of the 1993 Venice Biennial; <i>DER BEV�LKERUNG</i> (To the Population) of 2000 at the Berlin Reichstag; <i>Mixed Messages</i>, an exhibition of objects from the Victoria and Albert Museum (2001); and <i>Gift Horse</i>, unveiled on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square in 2015.</p></p><p>Hans Haacke is a German-born artist who lives and works in New York. From 1967 to 2002, he taught at The Cooper Union.<p>Hans Haacke's singular distinction is of the hard won, genuine kind, an eminent isolation shared in the twentieth century perhaps only by John Heartfield and Piero Manzoni (two figures of greatest importance for his own formation). Since the late 1960s, he diagnosed contexts of culture that nobody had seen (e.g., the necessary politics of ecology), and was the single voice in analyzing the economies of corporate culture nobody wanted to see. Equally blocked from American institutional recognition as he was isolated from art historical contexts (neither accepted as Minimalist nor as Conceptual artist), Haacke is now all the more distinguished by the impact his works and his writings have had on two generations of artists who have followed his models of critical analysis and cultural contestation, ranging from Martha Rosler to Allan Sekula, from Louise Lawler to Mark Lombardi, from Walid Raad to Hito Steyerl.</p>&#x2015;<b>Benjamin H. D. Buchloh</b>, Andrew W. Mellon Professor of Modern Art, Harvard University; author of <i>Neo-Avantgarde and Culture Industry</i> and <i>Formalism and Historicity</i><br><br><p>Haacke is undoubtedly an essential figure in the art of the last half century. For him, artistic practice, politics, and the institution are inextricably linked, and cannot be understood in isolation from each other. He has been among the artists who have reflected most penetratingly on the artist's conditions of production. This book, an exhaustive compilation of his writings, provides a unique insight into his work, and so illuminates our era.</p>&#x2015;<b>Manuel Borja-Villel</b>, Director, Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sof�a, Madrid<br><br><p>With this book, we now have a full collection of Haacke's crucial statements, allowing the span of his career from systems art to institutional critique to be fully assessed.&nbsp;As pithy as they are indispensable, Haacke's writings capture the fierce ethics that he has always brought to his practice&#x2015;now summarized in a useful introduction by Alex Alberro.</p>&#x2015;<b>Caroline A. Jones</b>, Professor and Director, History Theory Criticism Section, MIT Architecture Department; curator and author of <i>Hans Haacke 1967</i><br><br><p>This comprehensive collection of Haacke's trenchant writings demonstrates the full breadth of his concerns&#x2013;from postformalism to urbanism, ecology to labor relations&#x2013;as well as the full range of theoretical positions he has drawn on to articulate them, from systems theory to sociology. It also features a number of important, previously unpublished texts, including an early critique of kinetic art and a recent one of speculative property development.

In the early chapters, there is more attention to the origins of foreign policy institutions and practices, including precedents for the executive agreement, and new discussions of U.S. relations with Britain in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The more recent chapters feature fresh insights on Potsdam, the origins of the Korean War, and the Cuban Missile Crisis&#x2015;all based on new evidence drawn from Soviet archives.

His narrative account features several major themes: the connections between U.S. foreign policy and domestic politics; the impact of American economic development on foreign policy interests; popular culture, particularly film, as a filter for public opinion on American commitments abroad; the roles of public opinion, leadership, and bureaucracy in the formation of policy.</p><p>Walter LaFeber is professor of history at Cornell University and the author of The Clash and Inevitable Revolutions.</p><h2>The Art of the Bird: The History of Ornithological Art through Forty Artists</h2><p>The human history of depicting birds dates to as many as 40,000 years ago, when Paleolithic artists took to cave walls to capture winged and other beasts. But the art form has reached its peak in the last four hundred years. In&nbsp;<i>The Art of the Bird</i>, devout birder and ornithologist Roger J. Lederer celebrates this heyday of avian illustration in forty artists&#x2019; profiles, beginning with the work of Flemish painter Frans Snyders in the early 1600s and continuing through to contemporary artists like Elizabeth Butterworth, famed for her portraits of macaws. Stretching its wings across time, taxa, geography, and artistic style&#x2014;from the celebrated realism of American conservation icon John James Audubon, to Elizabeth Gould&#x2019;s nineteenth-century renderings of museum specimens from the Himalayas, to Swedish artist and ornithologist Lars Jonsson&#x2019;s ethereal watercolors&#x2014;this book is feathered with art and artists as diverse and beautiful as their subjects.

Based in large part on previously unavailable sources, including the recently discovered papers of Knox&#x2019;s close friend and colleague Christopher Goodman, Dawson&#x2019;s biography challenges the traditionally held stereotype of this founder of the Presbyterian denomination as a strident and misogynist religious reformer whose influence rarely extended beyond Scotland. She maintains instead that John Knox relied heavily on the support of his &#x201c;godly sisters&#x201d; and conferred as well as argued with Mary, Queen of Scots. He was a proud member of the European community of Reformed Churches and deeply involved in the religious Reformations within England, Ireland, France, Switzerland, and the Holy Roman Empire. Casting a surprising new light on the public and private personas of a highly complex, difficult, and hugely compelling individual, Dawson&#x2019;s fascinating study offers a vivid, fully rounded portrait of this renowned Scottish preacher and prophet who had a seismic impact on religion and society.</p><p>In this definitive new biography of British preacher, prophet, and reformer John Knox, Jane Dawson shatters the myths, misconceptions, and stereotypes surrounding the controversial leader of the Protestant Reformation in sixteenth-century Scotland.<b>Jane Dawson</b> is John Laing Professor of Reformation History, School of Divinity, University of Edinburgh.

From disabling pain to end-of-life pain to fetal pain, the battle over whose pain is real and who deserves relief has created stark ideological divisions at the bedside, in politics, and in the courts.</p><p>Beginning with the return of soldiers after World War II and fierce medical and political disagreements about whether pain constitutes a true disability, Wailoo explores the 1960s rise of an expansive liberal pain standard along with the emerging conviction that subjective pain was real, disabling, and compensable. These concepts were attacked during the Reagan era, when a conservative backlash led to diminished disability aid and an expanding role of courts as arbiters in the politicized struggle to define pain. New fronts in pain politics opened nationwide as advocates for death with dignity insisted that end-of-life pain warranted full relief, while the religious right mobilized around fetal pain.</p><p>The book ends with the 2003 OxyContin arrest of conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, a cautionary tale about deregulation and the widening gaps between the overmedicated and the undertreated.</p></p><p><p>Pain touches sensitive nerves in American liberalism, conservatism, and political life.</p><p><b>Keith Wailoo</b> is the Townsend Martin Professor of History and Public Affairs and Vice Dean of the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University.

Paul was prompted to write to the Colossian assembly when he heard that "false teachers" had joined the congregation and were advocating dangerous, non-Christian practices. In an effort to appear superior, these heretical teachers were luring Christians to exercise asceticism, moral rigorism, and esoteric rituals, hallmarks of other "mystery" and pagan cults.

Transcending the clash of older ideas about matter and space, acclaimed physicist Frank Wilczek explains a remarkable new discovery: matter is built from almost weightless units, and pure energy is the ultimate source of mass. He calls it "The Lightness of Being." Space is no mere container, empty and passive. It is a dynamic Grid-a modern ether- and its spontaneous activity creates and destroys particles. This new understanding of mass explains the puzzling feebleness of gravity, and a gorgeous unification of all the forces comes sharply into focus.<i>The Lightness of Being</i> is the first book to explore the implications of these revolutionary ideas about mass, energy, and the nature of "empty space." In it, Wilczek masterfully presents new perspectives on our incredible universe and envisions a new golden age of fundamental physics.<br><br></p><p><b>Frank Wilczek</b> is the Herman Feshbach Professor of Physics at MIT.

Miller tells the story of that transformation, showing how a group of influential far-right businessmen, religious leaders, and political operatives developed a potent mix of hardline anticommunism, biblical literalism, and racism to generate a violent populism&#x2014;and widespread power. Though those figures were seen as extreme in Texas and elsewhere, mainstream Republicans nonetheless found themselves forced to make alliances, or tack to the right on topics like segregation. As racial resentment came to fuel the national Republican party&#x2019;s divisive but effective &#x201c;Southern Strategy,&#x201d; the power of the extreme conservatives rooted in Texas only grew.<br> Drawing direct lines from Dallas to DC, Miller's captivating history offers a fresh understanding of the rise of the new Republican Party and the apocalyptic language, conspiracy theories, and ideological rigidity that remain potent features of our politics today.</p><p>Edward H.

(<i>Bookforum</i>)<br><br>"A solidly researched, well-argued, and illuminating work." (<i>Washington Independent Review of Books</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Miller painstakingly details how a combination of newfound wealth (and a desire to hold on to it), a sudden rise of the middle class (which allowed for a single breadwinner and freed wives to dabble in politics), and the need for new residents to assimilate resulted in a highly conservative political stance riddled with deep-seated racism and 'conspiratorial' John Bircher thinking. Miller&#x2019;s outstanding research allows him to weave a number of parallel stories, most notably his portrayal of the role of women working behind the scenes to enact this political shift. An insightful examination of a political shift that endures to this day.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>"A well-argued and compelling account. . . . Worth reading for the anecdotes alone." (<i>American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"With Texas-sized ambition and a touch of flair, Edward Miller taps the fascinating history of a surprisingly understudied place--Dallas, the 'Athens of the Southwest'--to reorient our understanding of America's Republican Right. Out of the heated warfare that divided this city&#x2019;s ultra- and moderate conservatives during the 1950s and 1960s emerged a pragmatic, potent, and anxious Republicanism that would capture the south in the 1970s and the nation in the years that followed. Packed full with colorful characters and surprising turning points, rich with historical insight yet pertinent to today, <i>Nut Country</i> is a book that students of U.S. (not just Texas!) history need to digest in order to appreciate why the 'Big D's' brand of politics has long held sway." (Darren Dochuk, author of From Bible Belt to Sunbelt)<br><br>"If you want to read a riveting account of how the Republican Party became conservative after World War II, pick up a copy of Edward H. Miller's <i>Nut Country</i>. What makes this journey into political history so captivating is the local story of Dallas. From the pews of the First Baptist Church to the lobby of the Adolphus Hotel, Miller walks his readers vividly through the webs of family ties, social rituals, and political brokering through which locals participated in establishing a spectrum of conservative positions rather than a set ideological stance. Be prepared to have your definition of 'conservative' broadened by the fine research of this book." (Michelle Nickerson, author of Mothers of Conservatism)<br><br>"Phoenix, Orange County, and even bucolic Sharon, Connecticut can all lay claim to being foundational places in the making of modern conservatism. Edward Miller moves our sights to the Lone Star state.&nbsp;He makes a bold and convincing claim that if you want to understand the conservative movement, we have to reckon with Dallas, Texas: 'Nut Country.' Featuring a memorable cast of characters--H. L. Hunt and General Edwin Walker not the least among them--Miller's book reveals how conservatives used racial politics in Dallas to change the fortunes, forever after, of the American right and the Republican Party."

It culminates with an in-depth exploration of the various types of insight and spiritual fruits that the practice yields.<br> <br> Authored by the master who brought insight meditation to the West and whose students include Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, and Sharon Salzberg, <i>Manual of Insight </i>is a veritable Bible for any practitioner of vipassana.&nbsp;</p><p><b>The Venerable Mahasi Sayadaw</b> (1904-82), U Sobhana Mahathera, was one of the most eminent meditation masters of modern times and a leader in the contemporary resurgence of Vipassana meditation. He quickly distinguished himself after ordination as a scholar and teacher of the Buddhist scriptures. Placing himself under the guidance of Venerable U Narada Sayadaw and undertaking intensive training in Vipassana meditation, he mastered the technique and went on to popularize vipassana as a systematic practice beneficial for monks and laity alike.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw held Burma's highest scholastic honor, the title of Agga Mahapandita, awarded to him in 1952. During the Sixth Buddhist Council, held in Rangoon from 1954 to 1956, he performed the duties of Questioner (pucchaka), a role performed at the First Buddhist Council by the Venerable Mahakassapa. Ven. Mahasi<br> <br>Sayadaw was also a member of the executive committee that was responsible, as the final authority, for the codification of all the texts edited at the Council.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thousands of people have been trained at his Thathana Yeiktha Meditation Centre in Yangon and many more have benefited from his clear-cut approach to meditation practice available through his voluminous writings and through the teachings abroad of his disciples, including Joseph Goldstein, Jack Kornfield, Sharon Salzberg, Rodney Smith, and many others. More than a hundred branch centers of the Thathana Yeiktha Centre have been established in Burma and his method has spread widely to other countries, East and West.<br> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ven. Mahasi Sayadaw is the author of numerous works on both meditation and the Buddhist scriptures in his native Burmese.&#x201c;The teachings of Mahasi Sayadaw formed the essential context in which I learned, practiced and studied meditation. That context is beautifully expressed in this book. I owe an inexpressible debt to Mahasi Sayadaw&#x2019;s scholarship, understanding, and courage of transmission. It is a great gift to have this translation available.&#x201d; Author: Sharon Salzberg, author of Lovingkindness<br><br>&#x201c;Having ordained under Mahasi Sayadaw, I know him as one of the most influential Theravada Buddhist teachers of the 20th century.

G. Wells predicted that statistical thinking would be as necessary for citizenship in a technological world as the ability to read and write. But in the twenty-first century, we are often overwhelmed by a baffling array of percentages and probabilities as we try to navigate in a world dominated by statistics. <p> Cognitive scientist Gerd Gigerenzer says that because we haven't learned statistical thinking, we don't understand risk and uncertainty. In order to assess risk -- everything from the risk of an automobile accident to the certainty or uncertainty of some common medical screening tests -- we need a basic understanding of statistics. </p><p> Astonishingly, doctors and lawyers don't understand risk any better than anyone else. Gigerenzer reports a study in which doctors were told the results of breast cancer screenings and then were asked to explain the risks of contracting breast cancer to a woman who received a positive result from a screening. The actual risk was small because the test gives many false positives. But nearly every physician in the study overstated the risk. Yet many people will have to make important health decisions based on such information and the interpretation of that information by their doctors. </p><p> Gigerenzer explains that a major obstacle to our understanding of numbers is that we live with an illusion of certainty. Many of us believe that HIV tests, DNA fingerprinting, and the growing number of genetic tests are absolutely certain. But even DNA evidence can produce spurious matches. We cling to our illusion of certainty because the medical industry, insurance companies, investment advisers, and election campaigns have become purveyors of certainty, marketing it like a commodity. </p><p> To avoid confusion, says Gigerenzer, we should rely on more understandable representations of risk, such as absolute risks. For example, it is said that a mammography screening reduces the risk of breast cancer by 25 percent. But in absolute risks, that means that out of every 1,000 women who do not participate in screening, 4 will die; while out of 1,000 women who do, 3 will die. A 25 percent risk reduction sounds much more significant than a benefit that 1 out of 1,000 women will reap. </p><p> This eye-opening book explains how we can overcome our ignorance of numbers and better understand the risks we may be taking with our money, our health, and our lives.</p></p><p>In the tradition of <i>Innumeracy</i> by John Allen Paulos, German scientist Gerd Gigerenzer offers his own take on numerical illiteracy. "In Western countries, most children learn to read and write, but even in adulthood, many people do not know how to think with numbers," he writes. "I focus on the most important form of innumeracy in everyday life, statistical innumeracy--that is, the inability to reason about uncertainties and risk." The author wisely uses concrete examples from the real world to make his points, and he shows the devastating impact of this problem. In one example, he describes a surgeon who advised many of his patients to accept prophylactic mastectomies in order to dodge breast cancer. In a two-year period, this doctor convinced 90 "high-risk" women without cancer to sacrifice their breasts "in a heroic exchange for the certainty of saving their lives and protecting their loved ones from suffering and loss." But Gigerenzer shows that the vast majority of these women (84 of them, to be exact) would not have developed breast cancer at all. If the doctor or his patients had a better understanding of probabilities, they might have chosen a different course. Fans of <i>Innumeracy</i> will enjoy <i>Calculated Risks</i>, as will anyone who appreciates a good puzzle over numbers. <i>--John Miller</i><b>Gerd Gigerenzer</b> is director of the Center for Adaptive Behavior and Cognition at the Max Planck Institute for Human Development in Berlin, Germany.

He attended the Boston Latin School, and in 1817 entered Harvard, graduating in 1820. Emerson supported himself as a schoolteacher from 1821-26. In 1826 he was "approbated to preach," and in 1829 became pastor of the Scond Church (Unitarian) in Boston. That same year he married Ellen Louise Tucker, who was to die of tuberculosis only seventeen months later. In 1832 Emerson resigned his pastorate and traveled to Eurpe, where he met Coleridge, Wordsworth, and Carlyle. He settled in Concord, Massachusetts, in 1834, where he began a new career as a public lecturer, and married Lydia Jackson a year later. A group that gathered around Emerson in Concord came to be known as "the Concord school," and included Bronson Alcott, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Margaret Fuller. Every year Emerson made a lecture tour; and these lectures were the source of most of his essays. <b>Nature</b> (1836), his first published work, contained the essence of his transcendental philosophy , which views the world of phenomena as a sort of symbol of the inner life and emphasizes individual freedom and self-reliance. Emerson's address to the Phi Beta Kappa society of Harvard (1837) and another address to the graduating class of the Harvard Divinity School (1838) applied his doctrine to the scholar and the clergyman, provoking sharp controversy. An ardent abolitionist, Emerson lectured and wrote widely against slavery from the 1840's through the Civil War. His principal publications include two volumes of <b>Essays</b> (1841, 1844), <b>Poems</b> (1847), <b>Representative Men</b> (1850), <b>The Conduct of Life</b> (1860), and <b>Society and Solitude</b> (1870).

In one of the most detailed descriptions of a CIA operation every written, the bizarre twists and turns of the full story are told in CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR. Veteran 60 Minutes producer George Crile explains how one Congressman was able to provide the CIA with hundreds of millions of dollars to fund the Afghan program, dwarfing the price tag for arming the Nicaraguan Contras that occurred at virtually the same time.<br><br>"The scope and nature of this campaign has still not registered in the consciousness of most Americans," Crile writes in the book's Epilogue. "Nor is it understood that such secret undertakings inevitably have unforeseen and unintended consequences which, in this case, remain largely ignored."<br><br>When Crile produced his first story about Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson for 60 Minutes in 1989, he too underestimated the vastness of the program and its consequences. It was a later trip to the Arab world with Wilson, the Wilson's "princely" reception, and the events of 9/11 that opened his eyes to the far bigger picture of CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR.<br><br>Among the book's more startling revelations:<br><br>� By the latter years of the 1980s the CIA was not just providing arms to a half million Afghans, it had taken 150,000 of them and transformed them into what it called a force of "techno holy warriors." "From today's perspective," Crile observes, "that may seem more than a bit ill advised-particularly when you factor in the specialized training in urban warfare that the Agency sponsored to include the use of pipe bombs, bicycle bombs, car bombs, camel bombs, along with a host of other tactics to wreak havoc with the army of a modern superpower."<br><br>� The United States continued to fund the Afghan rebels long after the withdrawal of the Soviet Union. Incredibly, the subsidies continued despite the fact that one of the most important mujahid leaders sided with Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War.<br><br>� In addition to $200 million in aid from the U.S. and $200 million from Saudi Arabia, in 1991 and 1992 the rebels received Iraqi weapons captured by U.S. forces during the Gulf War. At the same time, the Berlin Wall came down and the Soviet Union ceased to exist. The Cold War was effectively over but what began as a war against Communism was continuing to be funded.<br><br>"The question that has puzzled so many Americans: 'Why do they hate us?' is not so difficult to understand if you put yourself into the shoes of the Afghan veterans in the aftermath of the Soviet departure," Crile says. To them, the real superpower in their struggle was Allah. The United States eventually cut off its support in the 1990s. In the Afghan's minds, Allah did not.<br><br>CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is nothing short of a critical missing chapter in our political consciousness. Without a clear understanding of its impact, it may be impossible to comprehend the two world changing events that shook the United States on either side of the millennium: the sudden and mysterious collapse of the Soviet Union and the equally inexplicable appearance of a new global foe in the form of militant Islam. At its core, it tells of an unorthodox alliance-of a scandal-prone Texas Congressman named Charlie Wilson and an out-of-favor CIA operative named Gust Avrakotos-that armed and sustained the Afghan jihad and turned Afghanistan into the Soviet Union's Vietnam.<br><br>"The origins of this book go back to a time when the Afghans were viewed by most everyone in the U.S. government as freedom fighters and allies against a common foe," Crile writes in the Epilogue. In 1988, Crile produced a 60 Minutes profile of Wilson that he now realizes barely scratched the surface of this fascinating story. Later, while, accompanying Wilson on a trip to Kuwait, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Afghanistan just prior to the first Gulf War, Crile was amazed at the "princely" reception accorded Wilson in the Arab world. "The trip was just the beginning of a decade-long odyssey uncovering the many dimensions of the CIA's Afghan War," he recalls. "In short order I realized that it had been anything but a typical CIA program."<br><br>As incredible as anything in the pages of Tom Clancy or John le Carr�, CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is a gripping story of international intrigue, booze, drugs, sex, high society and arms deals. Between its covers, we meet:<br><br>� The charismatic Congressman Charlie Wilson. While Ronald Reagan and William Casey were unable to persuade Congress to fund the Nicaraguan Contras, Wilson was procuring hundreds of millions of dollars to support his Afghan "freedom fighters" through back-room machinations that would have made even LBJ blush. A colorful man of many contradictions, he worked hard and played hard, earning the reputation as the "wildest man in Congreeeeeess" while representing an archconservative Bible-belt district in Texas.<br><br>� The out-of-favor CIA operative, Gust Avrakotos, whose working-class Greek-American background made him an anomaly in the patrician world of American spies. Nicknamed "Dr. Dirty", this blue collar James Bond was an aggressive agent who served on the front lines of the Cold War where he learned how to stretch the Agency's rules to the breaking point.<br><br>� The eccentric staff of CIA outcasts hand-picked by Avrakotos to run the operation. Among them were "Hilly Billy", the logistics wizard who could open an un-numbered Swiss bank account for the U.S. government in 12 hours when others took months; Art Alper, the "devilish" tinkerer from the Technical Services division who roamed the world creating such novelties as exploding typewriters and developed portable amplifiers that spread propaganda among the Soviet troops; and especially Mike Vickers, the former Green Beret so junior in status that he couldn't send his own cables. His military genius allowed him to single-handedly redesign the CIA's war plan. Through his highly specific blueprint, he created a systematic plan that turned a rabble of shepherds and tribesmen into an army of techno Holy warriors who gave the legendary Red Army their greatest defeat. Today, Mike Vickers is consulting for the Pentagon on the War on Terrorism and war planning for Iraq.<br>The many women who shared the Congressman's jihad. It all began with a Houston socialite, Joanne Herring who enlisted Wilson to the Afghan cause via her deep-seated hatred of Communism and her influence in Pakistan. Carol Shannon, Wilson's personal belly dancer who he took with him to the jihad. Charlie's Angels, Wilson's female staffers so strikingly beautiful that they became a legend on Capitol Hill.

A dictator whom many held personally responsible for the execution of his democratically elected predecessor, Zia used his favorable status as an ally of the U.S. against the Soviets to divert attention from his own nuclear weapons program while providing the all-important safe haven and operations center for the CIA's Afghan operations .<br><br>CHARLIE WILSON'S WAR is the CIA and Congress as they have never been seen before, engaged in the last great battle of the Cold War.

He lives in New York with his wife and family.Inspired by the courage of the under-armed mujahideen in Afghanistan in their fight against the Soviet Union in the early 1980s, colorful Texas Congressman Charlie Wilson used all his political savvy, and a compliant CIA operative, to instigate the largest covert war in U.S. history. Narrator Christopher Lane effects an even tone and pace, allowing the events of the story to propel the listener through the extraordinary highs and sickening lows of the flawed but heroic Wilson. Thankfully, Lane takes it easy on the accents and shines brightest when allowing a tinge of cynicism in his delivery. Wilson's war may have helped end the Cold War, but did it embolden the victors, bringing on the current war on terrorism? That answer is left to the listener.

Richard King analyzes the schools' different doctrines and compares their approaches to specific philosophical topics &#x2015; ontology, epistemology, perception, consciousness, and creation and causality. <br><br>While King's main focus is on the ideas as professed by the major schools of thought, he also takes into account the important contributions made by individual thinkers. Among these are Bhartrhari, who helped introduce linguistic analysis into Indian philosophy; Nagarjuna, the reputed founder of the Mahayana or "Middle Way" school; and Asanga, the believed founder of the Yogacara or "Practice of Yoga" school. <br><br>This is the first introduction to Indian philosophy written for a western audience to assess Indian thought in its own context and to examine its relationship with the West. King discusses the nature of philosophy in general, examining the shifting usage of the term throughout history. He examines western perceptions of Indian philosophy, exploring the reasons why it has not made substantial inroads into western intellectual discourse. <br><br>King argues that western scholars will remain tied to a Eurocentric perspective as long as they continue to ignore the possibility of philosophical thought "East of the Suez." This, he argues, highlights the need for a post-colonial and global approach to philosophy. <br><br>Written in a clear and accessible style, the book can be used for courses in religion, theology, and philosophy.</p><p><b>Richard King</b> is a reader in religious studies at the University of Stirling in Scotland.

He argues that Britain led the rest of Europe into the Industrial Revolution because it was there that the optimal intersection of ideas, culture, institutions, and technology existed to make rapid economic growth achievable.

That's exactly what Don Meyer, creator of Sibshops and author of VIEWS FROM OUR SHOES did when he invited together a group of 80 teenagers, from all over the United States and abroad, to talk about what it's like to have a brother or sister with special needs. Their unedited words are found in THE SIBLING SLAM BOOK, a brutally honest, non-PC look at the lives, experiences, and opinions of siblings without disabilities. Formatted like the slam books passed around in many junior high and high schools, this one poses a series of 50 personal questions along the lines of: What should we know about you? What do you tell your friends about your sib's disability? What's the weirdest question you have ever been asked about your sib? If you could change one thing about your sib (or your sib's disability) what would it be? What annoys you most about how people treat your sib? THE SIBLING SLAM BOOK doesn't slam in the traditional sense of the word. The tone and point-of-view of the answers are all over the map. Some answers are assuredly positive, a few are strikingly negative, but most reflect the complex and conflicted mix of emotions that come with the territory. Whether they read it cover to cover or sample it at random, teenagers will surely find common ground among these pages and reassurance that they are not alone. It is a book that parents, friends, and counselors can feel confident recommending to any teenager with a brother or sister with a disability. <p> <i>Also by Don Meyer</i>:<br> <b>Views from Our Shoes: Growing Up with a Brother or Sister with Special Needs</b><br> <b>Thicker than Water: Essays by Adult Siblings of People with Disabilities</b></p></p><p>Don Meyer is the Director of the Sibling Support Project of The Arc of the United States and the creator of the Sibshop model.

He has conducted more than 200 workshops for siblings, parents, and service providers in the United States and all over the world. He lives in Seattle with his wife, Terese, and their four children.Starred Review. Grade 6 Up&#x2013;This multifaceted vehicle for eliciting some unique and many universal emotions is designed specifically for siblings of special-needs children. An adolescent mainstay, the slam book is the chosen venue for encouraging the venting of opinions, hopes, fears, frustrations, and triumphs. Comments by 81 young people display the recurring theme of optimism, complicated by hard work, dedication, resentment, and fierce protection, all as by-products of love. Some questions serve as icebreakers, such as "What should we know about you?" and "What should we know about your sib?" while thought-provoking chapters include "What life lesson have you learned from being a sib?" and "What are some advantages&#x2013;good parts&#x2013;of having a sibling with a disability?" Typical slam-book questions such as "Has your sib ever embarrassed you?" are interspersed with chapters like "Ever feel invisible?" Answers from the large sample group supply ample material so that each reader is sure to relate to some of the thoughtful or heartfelt responses. Highly recommended for all middle, high school, and public libraries.<i>&#x2013;Sharon A.

H. Lawrence&#x2019;s provocative novel traces the lives of three generations of one family on their Nottinghamshire farm. Rooted in an agrarian past, Tom and Lydia Brangwen and their descendants find themselves navigating a rapidly changing world&#x2014;a world of unprecedented individualism, alienation, and liberation. Banned after an obscenity trial in 1915 for its frankness about sexuality, THE RAINBOW was most remarkable for the pathbreaking journeys of its female characters, particularly that of Ursula Brangwen, whose destiny Lawrence explored further in his next novel, <i>Women in Love.</i><br><br>In its surface drama, in its capacious and expansive rhythms that so resemble the rhythms of nature itself, THE RAINBOW is one of the world&#x2019;s great examples of the multi-generational family saga. But the large claim that Lawrence&#x2019;s masterpiece has made on the attention of readers and critics stems less from this fact than from the deeper parallel history he provides for the Brangwens&#x2014;a history of the growth of their souls, moving in a great arc from sensuality to self-awareness and freedom.<br></p></p><p>D. H. Lawrence started &#39;The Sisters&#39; in 1913, wrote four different versions and claimed to have discarded &#39;quite a thousand pages&#39; before completing The Rainbow in 1915. Mark Kinkead-Weekes gives the composition history and collates the surviving states of the text to assess the damage done to Lawrence&#39;s great novel.Set in the rural midlands of England, D.H. Lawrence&#39;s &#39;The Rainbow&#39; explores the lives of three generations of the Brangwen family, conveying how their rural existence is gradually but profoundly changed by the influx of industry and urbanism. But it is young Ursula Brangwen, discovering herself through her sexual awakening, who becomes the focus of Lawrence&#39;s classic work, which was banned by court order when it was first published in London in 1915.</p><h2>The Cellars of the Majestic (Inspector Maigret)</h2><p><b><b>&#x201c;One of the greatest writers of the twentieth century . . .

Prosper Donge&#x2019;s Tyre</p> <p>A car door slamming. That was always the first noise of the day. The engine still running outside. Charlotte was presumably shaking the driver&#x2019;s hand. Then the taxi drove away. Footsteps. The key in the lock and the click of a light switch.</p> <p>A match was struck in the kitchen, and the gas stove made a <i>phffft</i> sound as it came on.</p> <p>Slowly, like someone who has spent all night standing up, Charlotte climbed the overly new staircase. She came noiselessly into the bedroom. Another light switch. A bulb came on, with a pink handkerchief over it as a lampshade and wooden tassels at the four corners of the handkerchief.</p> <p>Prosper Donge had not opened his eyes. Charlotte looked at herself in the wardrobe mirror as she undressed. When she got down to her girdle and brassiere, she sighed. She was as fat and pink as a Rubens, but she was obsessive about squeezing herself in. Once naked, she rubbed the flesh where there were marks.</p> <p>She had an unpleasant way of getting into bed, kneeling on it first, which made the base tilt to one side.</p> <p>&#x2018;Your turn, Prosper!&#x2019;</p> <p>He got up. She quickly huddled into the warm hollow he had left behind, pulled the blankets up to her eyes and stopped moving.</p> <p> &#x2018;Is it raining?&#x2019; he asked as he flushed the toilet.</p> <p>A vague grunt. It didn&#x2019;t matter. The water for shaving was ice cold. Trains could be heard passing.</p> <p>Prosper Donge got dressed. From time to time, Charlotte sighed, because she couldn&#x2019;t get to sleep while the light was on. He had one hand already on the doorknob and was stretching his right arm towards the light switch when he heard a thick voice:</p> <p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t forget to go and pay the instalment for the wireless.&#x2019;</p> <p>On the kitchen stove, the coffee was hot, too hot. He drank it standing up. Then, like all those who make the same gestures at the same time every day, he wrapped a knitted scarf around his neck and put on his coat and cap.</p> <p>Finally, he took his bicycle, which was in the passage, and pushed it outside.</p> <p>Invariably, at that hour, he was greeted by a breath of cold, damp air, and there was wetness on the cobbles, even though it hadn&#x2019;t rained; the people asleep behind the closed shutters would probably know only a warm, sunny day.</p> <p>The street, lined with detached houses and little gardens, sloped steeply downwards. Sometimes, between two trees, the lights of Paris could be glimpsed, as if at the bottom of a chasm.</p> <p>It was no longer night, but it wasn&#x2019;t yet day. The air was mauve. The lights were coming on in a few windows, and Prosper Donge braked before he got to the level crossing, which was closed. He had to get across through the gates.</p> <p>After the Pont de Saint-Cloud, he turned left. A tugboat followed by its string of barges was whistling furiously, asking for the lock gate to be opened.</p> <p>The Bois de Boulogne ... The lakes reflecting a paler sky, with swans waking up ...</p> <p>Just as he reached Porte Dauphine, the ground suddenly felt harder beneath Donge&#x2019;s wheels. He went a few more metres, then got off and had a look. His rear tyre was flat.</p> <p>He looked at his watch. It was ten to six. He began walking quickly, pushing his bicycle, and there was a slight mist in front of his lips, while the heat of the effort burned his chest inside.</p> <p>Avenue Foch ... Closed shutters in all the mansions ... A high-ranking officer, followed only by his orderly, was trotting along the bridle path ...</p> <p>Light behind the Arc de Triomphe ... He was hurrying now ... He felt really hot ...</p> <p>Just at the corner of the Champs-�lys�es, a policeman in a cape, standing near the news stand, cried out:</p> <p>&#x2018;Flat tyre?&#x2019;</p> <p>He nodded. Three hundred metres to go. The Hotel Majestic, on the left, with all its shutters closed. The streetlamps were no longer giving out much light.</p> <p>He turned into Rue de Berri, then Rue de Ponthieu. A little bar was open. Two buildings further on, a door that passers-by never noticed, the service entrance of the Majestic.</p> <p>A man was just coming out. A suit could be glimpsed under his grey coat. He was bare-headed. He had slicked-back hair, and Prosper Donge assumed it was the dancer, Zebio.</p> <p>He could have glanced into the bar to make sure, but the thought never occurred to him. Still pushing his bicycle, he entered a long grey passage lit by a single light. He stopped by the clocking-on machine, turned the wheel, inserted the card into his number, 67, and as he did so glanced at the little clock on the machine, which showed ten past six. A click.</p> <p>It was now an established fact that he had entered the Majestic at ten<i> past six in the morning, ten minutes later than usual.</i></p> <p>Such, at least, was the official statement of Prosper Donge, the head coffee maker for the luxury hotel on the Champs-�lys�es.</p> <p>As for what happened next, he claimed that he had continued to act as he did every morning.</p> <p>At that hour, the vast basement areas with their complicated corridors, their multiple doors, their walls painted grey like the gangways of a freighter, were deserted. Through the glass partitions, all you could see, here and there, were the dim bulbs with their yellowish filaments which constituted the night lighting.</p> <p>Everything had glass partitions, the kitchens on the left, then the bakery. Opposite, the room known as the couriers&#x2019; room, where the higher-ranking staff ate, along with the guests&#x2019; private domestics, their chambermaids and chauffeurs.</p> <p>A bit further along, the dining room for the lower-grade staff, with its long white wooden tables and its benches like the kind you find in schools.</p> <p>Finally, dominating the basement like the bridge of a ship, a smaller glass cage, where the bookkeeper sat, the man whose job it was to check everything that came out of the kitchens.</p> <p>As he opened the door to the coffee room, Prosper Donge had the impression that someone was climbing the narrow staircase that led to the upper floors, but paid no attention. That at least was what appeared subsequently in his statement.</p> <p>Just as Charlotte had done on entering their suburban house, he now struck a match, and the gas made a <i>phffft</i> sound under the smallest of the percolators, the one that came on first for the few guests who got up early.</p> <p>Only once he had done that did he go into the locker room. This was quite a large room along one of the corridors. There were several wash-basins, a greyish mirror and, along the walls, tall, narrow metal lockers, each bearing a number.</p> <p>With his key, he opened locker 67. He took off his coat, scarf and hat. He changed shoes: for his day&#x2019;s work he preferred elastic-sided shoes, which were softer. He put on a white jacket.</p> <p>A few more minutes ... At half past six, the basement areas started coming to life ...</p> <p>Up above, everything was asleep, apart from the night porter, who was waiting in the deserted lobby to be relieved.</p> <p>The percolator hissed. Donge filled a cup with coffee and set off up the staircase, which was like one of those mysterious staircases you find backstage in theatres that lead to the most unexpected places.</p> <p>When he opened a narrow door, he found himself in the lobby cloakroom. Nobody would have guessed the door was there, covered as it was with a large mirror.</p> <p>&#x2018;Coffee!&#x2019; he announced, placing the cup on the cloakroom counter. &#x2018;How&#x2019;s it going?&#x2019;</p> <p>&#x2018;Fine!&#x2019; the night porter grunted as he approached.</p> <p>Donge went back downstairs. His three women, the Three Fat Ladies as they were known, had arrived. They were lower-class women, all three ugly, one of them old and bad-tempered. They were already washing cups and saucers in the sink, making a great clatter.</p> <p>As for Donge, he did what he did every day, arranged the silver coffee pots in order of size: one cup, two cups, three cups ... Then the little milk jugs ... the teapots ...</p> <p>In the bookkeeper&#x2019;s glass cage, he glimpsed Jean Ramuel, his hair dishevelled.</p> <p>&#x2018;He must have slept here again!&#x2019; he observed.</p> <p>For three or four nights now, the bookkeeper, Ramuel, had been sleeping at the hotel rather than going home, which was somewhere in Montparnasse.</p> <p>As a rule, that was forbidden. At the very end of the corridor, near the door concealing the stairs to the lower basement, where the wines were kept, there was indeed a room with three or four beds. But theoretically they were reserved for those members of staff who needed a breather between busy periods.</p> <p>Donge waved a brief hello to Ramuel, who responded with a similarly vague gesture.</p> <p>Next, it was the turn of the head chef, huge and self-important, who had just returned from Les Halles with a lorry that parked in Rue de Ponthieu to be unloaded by his assistants.</p> <p>By half past seven, at least thirty people were bustling about in the basements of the Majestic. Bells started ringing, the dumb waiters came down, stopped and went back up with trays, while Ramuel stuck white, blue and pink slips on the iron spikes lined up on his desk.</p> <p>At that hour, the day porter, in his light-blue uniform, was just taking over the lobby and the mail clerk was sorting through the mail in his box room. It must be sunny in the Champs-�lys�es but, in the basement, the only thing you were aware of was the rumbling of the buses making the glass partitions vibrate.</p> <p>A few minutes after nine &#x2013; at exactly 9.04, as they were able to establish &#x2013; Prosper Donge left the coffee room and a few seconds later entered the locker room.</p> <p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;d left my handkerchief in my coat!&#x2019; he stated when he was questioned.</p> <p>Be that as it may, he now found himself alone in the room with its hundred metal lockers. Did he open his own? Nobody was there to witness it. Did he get his handkerchief? It was possible.</p> <p>There weren&#x2019;t a hundred, but exactly ninety-two lockers, all numbered. The last five were empty.</p> <p>Why did it occur to Prosper Donge to open locker 89, which, not belonging to anyone, wasn&#x2019;t locked?</p> <p>&#x2018;I did it without thinking ...&#x2019; he asserted. &#x2018;The door was ajar ... I never imagined ...&#x2019;</p> <p>What was in this locker was a body which must have been pushed into it in an upright position and had collapsed in on itself. It was the body of a woman of about thirty, very blonde &#x2013; artificially blonde, in fact &#x2013; wearing a thin black woollen dress.</p> <p>Donge did not cry out. Looking quite pale, he approached Ramuel&#x2019;s glass cage and bent down to speak through the opening.</p> <p>&#x2018;Come and have a look ...&#x2019;</p> <p>The bookkeeper followed him.</p> <p>&#x2018;Stay here ... Don&#x2019;t let anyone get too close ...&#x2019;</p> <p>Ramuel rushed upstairs, emerged in the lobby cloakroom and spotted the porter in conversation with a chauffeur.</p> <p>&#x2018;Has the manager arrived?&#x2019;</p> <p>The porter gestured with his chin towards the manager&#x2019;s office.</p> <p>Standing by the revolving door, Maigret was on the point of knocking his pipe against his heel to empty it. Then he shrugged and put it back between his teeth. It was his first pipe of the morning, the best one.</p> <p>&#x2018;The manager&#x2019;s expecting you, sir ...&#x2019;</p> <p>The lobby was not very busy yet. There was only an Englishman arguing with the mail clerk, and a young girl walking on her long grasshopper legs, carrying a hatbox, which she was presumably delivering.</p> <p>Maigret walked into the manager&#x2019;s office. The manager shook his hand without a word and indicated an armchair. A green curtain concealed the glass door, but you just had to pull it slightly to see everything that was happening in the lobby.</p> <p>&#x2018;Cigar?&#x2019;</p> <p> &#x2018;No, thanks ...&#x2019;</p> <p>They had known each other for a long time. They didn&#x2019;t need many words. The manager was wearing striped trousers, a dark jacket with edging and a tie that seemed to have been cut out of some stiff material.</p> <p>&#x2018;Here ...&#x2019;</p> <p>He pushed a registration form across the table.</p> <p> </p><p>Oswald J.

And what should it teach? In recent years, traditional Sunday school and education programs have declined in influence and effectiveness. Education in the church is often sidelined by other competing priorities, and our efforts become haphazard and random. As a result, many Christians have not learned the fundamental doctrinal content of the faith. As a response, a growing number of church ministries have moved toward an emphasis on Christian spiritual formation. But churches must hold together education and formation, the teaching of the faith and the forming of the faithful. In this comprehensive text, Gary Parrett and Steve Kang attend to both the content and process of educational and formational ministries. They set forth a thoroughly biblical vision for intentional teaching of the Christian faith, with a holistic concern for <em>what</em> and <em>whom</em> is taught as well as <em>how</em> and <em>why.</em> Fully apprised of developments in educational theory and pedagogy, Parrett and Kang propose a core curriculum for recovering the full scope of Christian proclamation and reinvigorating the teaching ministry of the church. Their vision has implications not merely for catechesis, but for preaching, worship, children's and youth ministry, and much more. The body of Christ can become all that God intends it to be, through intentional practices that foster personal and corporate formation. Here is guidance for individuals and congregations on that journey.</p><p><strong>Gary A. Parrett</strong> (Ed.D., Columbia) is associate professor of educational ministries and worship, and chair of the Division of the Ministry of the Church at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He is a coauthor of <em>A Many Colored Kingdom.</em><br><br><strong>S. Steve Kang</strong> (Ph.D., Northwestern/Garrett) is associate professor of educational ministries at Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary. He is the author of <em>Unveiling the Socioculturally Constructed Multivoiced Self,</em> coauthor of <em>A Many Colored Kingdom</em> and coeditor of <em>Growing Healthy Asian American Churches.</em><br><br>J. I. Packer is regarded as one of the most influential evangelicals in North America. He is Board of Governors' Professor of Theology at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, and his writings include books such as <em>Knowing God</em>, <em>A Quest for Godliness</em>, <em>Growing in Christ</em> (Crossway) and <em>Rediscovering Holiness</em>. He has preached and lectured widely in Great Britain and North America and served as general editor of the English Standard Version of the Bible published in 2001, and theological editor of the Study Bible version. In 2014, Packer was named Author of the Year by the Association of Logos Bookstores. He is a frequent contributor to and an executive editor of <em>Christianity Today</em> and has written numerous articles published in journals such as <em>Churchman, SouthWestern Journal, Reformation Revival Journal</em> and <em>Touchstone.</em> He received a BA, MA and PhD from Oxford University."<em>Teaching the Faith, Forming the Faithful</em> provides an integrated approach to contemporary educational ministry im the church. This book is a must-read for scholars, pastors, and laypeople serious about disciple-making." (Mark H. Heinemann, Journel of Evangelical Homiletics Society, March 2011)<br><br>"Instead of arguling that a church can either feed their members minds or feed their hearts, Parrett and Kang believe that a church should be doing both. And in this volume they lay out a plan for how to make that happen. They offer theory and theology; but they also offer a sample curriculum and questions for thinking through the church;s corporate worship." (Leadership Journal, (www.leadershipjournal.net), Spring 2010)<br><br>"In a well-researched and comprehensive work, Kang and Parrett provide a rich and nuanced introduction to Christian education well worth reading by all those committed to faithful teaching and formation in the third millennium. The biblical and theological connections provide a rich tapestry for thought and practice. I enthusiastically recommend this work for scholars and practitioners alike." (Robert W. Pazmi�o, Valeria Stone Professor of Christian Education, Andover Newton Theological School)<br><br>"This is the kind of book on the teaching ministry of the church that we have needed for some time! Parrett and Kang provide a solid biblical grounding for the purpose and practices of educational ministry, connecting it with the broader life and ministry of the church. Their 'take and bake' approach makes this a thought-provoking read, challenging church leaders to look more deeply into the nature of the church, its calling in the world, and the ways educational ministry can better strengthen the faith and faithfulness of God's people. This is a must-read for everyone in vocational ministry who desires to see the church grow into a more faithful image of Christ in this world." (Dr. Kevin E. Lawson, director, Ph.D. and Ed.D. programs in educational studies, and editor, Christian Education Journal, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University)<br><br>"Somewhere along the way, our ministries have become more concerned with implementing methodologies than with teaching meat. The sad outcome has been a church filled with people who have little or no idea how God's story speaks to them, or how they are to enthusiastically live out their place in God's story in the midst of a watching world. We are nurturing generations of children, youth and adults who have little or nothing stored in the well of their faith. Gary Parrett and Steve Kang remind us that our calling is to fill wells with an understanding of God's story that yields a church filled with stories that bring glory to God in every nook and cranny of life. <em>Teaching the Faith, Forming the Faithful</em> has the potential to transform our ministries, the people we minister to, the church and the world. Their diagnosis is accurate. Their practical prescriptive responses call readers to return to biblical roots that have long been forgotten. I will be recommending this book to youth workers, pastors, parents and educators." (Dr. Walt Mueller, president, The Center for Parent/Youth Understanding, and author of Engaging the Soul of Youth Culture)<br><br>"<em>Teaching the Faith, Forming the Faithful</em> is a fairly comprehensive orientation and guidebook for pastors and church leaders regarding the essential educational ministry of the church. The overall organization of the book is clear (aims, essential content of the gospel, participants, and processes and practices) and the last two chapters offer a macroframework for conceptualizing and guiding overall educational ministry practice. The authors' 'pastoral insider' perspective yields useful lists and suggestions that can easily be contextualized in any local church, especially those with a liturgical tradition. The book is biblically grounded throughout and offers a wide range of notes and resources from church history, making it a rich resource for the seminary classroom and on the pastor's shelf." (Klaus Issler, Ph.D., professor of Christian education and theology, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University, and author of Wasting Time with God)<br><br>"Although Parrett and Kang seem to misread my priorities in my first book on worship, still I heartily recommend their work! In this book's massive thoroughness, they skillfully explore all the major questions for a congregation's educational ministry. This volume's comprehensive view of spiritual formation is critically necessary&#x2015;and intensively beneficial!&#x2015;reading for everyone who serves to teach the faith, from the preschool Sunday school teacher to the senior pastor!" (Marva J. Dawn, teaching fellow in spiritual theology, Regent College, Vancouver, British Columbia, and author of Keeping the Sabbath Wholly, Is It a Lost Cause? and In the Beginning, GOD)<br><br>"This book moves almost seamlessly between Bible, theology and education to provide foundational insights into how the church must educate its members toward Christian maturity. In a time when serious education of believers has been neglected, this work offers an important and helpful corrective by using sound theology and the best of educational theory to guide the practice of the church." (Perry G. Downs, professor of educational ministries, Trinity Evangelical Divinity School)<br><br>"After reading <em>Teaching the Faith, Forming the Faithful</em> I concluded, 'This text is perfect for my Foundations for Educational Ministry course.' Grounded in Scripture, conversant with theory, spanning the globe and the centuries of Christian tradition, Parrett and Kang have produced a comprehensive study of the church's teaching ministry. It will ignite passion in its readers and equip them with a clear, compelling vision for educational ministry." (Robert Drovdahl, professor of educational ministry, Seattle Pacific University)<br><br>"A clarion call to the church to teach the Scriptures, learn what they teach and practice their truth. This is a challenge we need to heed today. Ours is a time when authentic faith is often overwhelmed by the triviality of our culture, by fascination with technique in our churches and by confusion as to what it means to be God's people in our own time. I therefore welcome this study!" (David F. Wells, Distinguished Research Professor, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary)</p><h2>The Dutch Revolt (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)</h2><p>This is a major new English-language edition of five central texts in the history of the political thought of the Dutch Revolt.

Nina Auerbach of the University of Pennsylvania (author of <i>Our Vampires, Ourselves</i>) and horror scholar David J. Skal (author of <i>Hollywood Gothic</i>, <i>The Monster Show</i>, and <i>Screams of Reason</i>) are the editors of the volume. Especially fascinating are excerpts from materials that Bram Stoker consulted in his research for the book, and his working papers over the several years he was composing it. The selection of criticism includes essays on how <i>Dracula</i> deals with female sexuality, gender inversion, homoerotic elements, and Victorian fears of "reverse colonization" by politically turbulent Transylvania.While serving as actor Henry Irving&#39;s business manager at the Lyceum Theatre in London, Bram Stoker (1847-1912) also pursued his literary interests. In this Gothic horror novel of 1897, which brought him international fame, he presents the chilling vampire Count Dracula, modelled in part on Irving&#39;s powerful personality.</p><h2>Spring&#39;s Gentle Promise (Seasons of the Heart #4)</h2><p>In the dimness of the early morning I could see field after neighborhood field as I let my gaze wander around me.

The author describes in detail, and with numerous architectural plans and drawings, the influence of the anatomy of the Japanese human body on traditional units of measurement and on house construction. This work is not simply a description of the features of the Japanese house, but &#34;an invitation to probe the possibilities of utilizing this architectural achievement of the Japanese ...in modern living and building,&#34; according to the author, who further believes that the unique features of the Japanese house are better suited to serve as a pattern for contemporary housing than any other form of residential structure.</p><p><b>Heino Engel</b> studied architecture in Germany immediately following the end of World War II, then traveled through Egypt and Arabia, spent more than a year in India, Burma, Malaysia, and Thailand, before arriving in Japan. There, in his own words, he "realized that the Japanese house is as invaluable an experience for the contemporary architect as are the ancient Acropolis of Athens in Greece and the modern high-rise office towers of the United States." He remained in Japan for three years, concentrating on the study of the Japanese house, people, life, language, and culture, and also becoming a member of the Architectural Institute of Japan.</p><h2>New &amp; Enlarged Handbook of Christian Theology</h2><p><p>An up-to-date and expanded version of a trusted textbook. </p> <p><em>The New &amp; Enlarged Handbook of Christian Theology</em> brings the information up to date and provides more than 30&nbsp;additional&nbsp;articles.

At the frontier, we can&#x2019;t avoid the truth; the comforting layers of the quotidian, which insulate us against the world&#x2019;s harsher realities, are stripped away and, wide-eyed in the harsh fluorescent light of the frontier&#x2019;s windowless halls, we see things as they are.<br><br>In Salman Rushdie&#x2019;s latest collection of nonfiction, he crosses over the frontier and sees and tells things as they are, inviting readers to &#x201c;step across this line&#x201d; with him. <br><br>The essays, speeches, and opinion pieces assembled in <b>Step Across This Line</b>, written over the last ten years, cover an astonishing range of subjects. The collection chronicles Rushdie&#x2019;s intellectual odyssey and is also an especially personal look into the writer&#x2019;s psyche. With the same fierce intelligence, uncanny social commentary, and very strong opinions that distinguish his fiction, Rushdie writes about his fascination with The Wizard of Oz, his obsession with soccer, and the state of the novel, among many other topics. Most notably, delving into his unique personal experience fighting the Iranian fatwa, he addresses the subject of militant Islam in a series of challenging and deeply felt responses to the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The book ends with the eponymous &#x201c;Step Across This Line,&#x201d; a lecture Rushdie delivered at Yale in the spring of 2002, which has never been published before and is sure to prompt discussion. <br><br>Rushdie&#x2019;s first collection of nonfiction, <b>Imaginary</b> <b>Homelands</b>, offered a unique vision of politics, literature, and culture for the 1980s.<b> Step Across This Line</b> does the same and more for the last decade of the twentieth century and the beginning of the twenty-first.</p><p>&#x201c;Step Across This Line is a moral tonic ...

Morgan Llywelyn&#x2019;s magisterial multi-novel chronicle of that story began with <i>1916</i>, which was followed by <i>1921</i>, <i>1949</i>, and <i>1972</i>. It now concludes with <i>1999: A Novel of the Celtic Tiger and the Search for Peace</i>. <i>1999</i> brings the story from <i>1972</i> to the disarmament talks and beginnings of reconciliation among the Irish at the end of the twentieth century. </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Barry Halloran, strong, clever, and passionately patriotic, who was the central character of <i>1972</i>, remains central.

This is a noble conclusion to an historical mega-novel that will be read for years.</p></p><p>MORGAN LLYWELYN lives near Dublin, IrelandChapter 1<br>Like candles blown out by a celestial wind, the last stars vanished.<br>The beam of headlamps swung wildly as the Austin Healey skidded on a patch of black ice. Barry Halloran turned into the skid and kept his foot on the accelerator. The green car fishtailed, teetered on the brink of a ditch, recovered and raced on.<br>Barry&#x2019;s anger was unstoppable.<br>He hardly saw the road. Other images clouded his vision like a double exposure. Unarmed civilians being shot down in the street. An injured man shot in the back at point-blank range as he lay writhing on the pavement. An old woman battered to the ground with the butt of a rifle. British soldiers sniggering while the still-bleeding bodies of their victims were tossed into trucks like sides of beef.<br>On the screen of Barry&#x2019;s mind the cinematic horror ran over and over again.<br>His knuckles were white on the steering wheel.<br>He had taken advantage of the better roads in Northern Ireland by driving south from Derry through Tyrone and Fermanagh. Avoiding the manned border crossing west of Enniskillen, he had entered the Republic of Ireland by a neglected byway, then angled southward again across Leitrim and Roscommon. Even when he reached County Galway very few lights were visible from the road. Much of the region was all but deserted. In the west of Ireland unemployment was endemic. Thousands of young men and women had &#x201c;taken the boat&#x201d; to England in search of jobs.<br>Signposts were notoriously unreliable. With nothing better to do, the local youngsters who remained behind often turned road signs to point in the wrong direction. The unwary driver could go miles out of his way before discovering his mistake.<br>Finbar Lewis Halloran needed no signposts to County Clare. The map was imprinted on the marrow of his bones.<br>By the time he turned into the country lane leading off the Ennis Road dawn was breaking. A sullen crimson dawn for the last day of January 1972. &#x201c;Red sky at night, farmers&#x2019; delight,&#x201d; Barry muttered to himself. &#x201c;Red sky at morning, farmers take warning.&#x201d;<br>Take warning, his tired brain echoed<br>Ancient hedgerows of furze and whitethorn rose like walls on either side of the laneway. Deep ruts held automobile tyres to the track. Once committed, a driver had no choice but to follow the lane to the end.<br>After a few hundred yards it came to a substantial farmhouse flanked by barns and outbuildings. Within easy sight from the house a large paddock waited to receive the broodmares, heavy with foal, who would be turned out later in the morning.<br>Everything looks the same. Thank God, it always looks the same. Barry could feel knots loosening in the pit of his stomach.<br>Built of local stone in the eighteenth century, the original tiny cottage had been altered repeatedly by successive generations of Hallorans. The house now comprised two full storeys with a steeply pitched slate roof bracketed by brick chimneys. In a rare fit of domesticity, Ursula Halloran had built an extension off the kitchen to hold an array of modern appliances, such as a washing machine and a freezer chest. She never got around to buying them. The space had become a catchall for muddy boots and a haven for orphaned farm animals.<br>Ursula referred to it as &#x201c;the nursery.&#x201d;<br>Barry slammed on the brakes and hurled himself from the car like a giant spring uncoiling. He was very tall and the leg space beneath the dashboard was insufficient. The long drive had caused his damaged leg to stiffen. When he stood upright a spear of pain shot through the muscles.<br>A swift intake of breath. A momentary closing of eyes. Then it was over.<br>Two long strides carried him to the house.<br>A light was burning in the parlour to the left of the hall. As he ran past, Barry glimpsed the huddled figure of his mother in her favourite armchair, where she sometimes fell asleep listening to the late news on the radio. He took the stairs three at a time. Raced to his room, flung open the door. Threw himself on his knees beside the bed and fumbled beneath the mattress. Inhaled the dusty scent of feathers and ticking, and linen bleached in the sun.<br>Grasped the polished stock of Ned Halloran&#x2019;s old rifle.<br>A woman said from the doorway, &#x201c;Thank God you&#x2019;re all right! When I rang your house in Dublin Barbara told me where you&#x2019;d gone. What just happened in Derry is all over the news, RTE even interrupted its regular programming. I&#x2019;ve been terrified.&#x201d;<br>The haggard man stood up with a rifle in his hands. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve never been terrified in your life, Ursula.&#x201d; His deep baritone voice was hoarse with weariness.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s all you know. What happened?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think I can talk about it, not yet.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Please, Barry.&#x201d;<br>Reluctantly, he dragged out the words that made it all real again. &#x201c;When the civil rights march formed up in the Creggan I was there with my cameras. A great opportunity for photojournalism, I thought. Images of hope in Northern Ireland after all these years. People came in the thousands, even from the Republic. Men and women, boys and girls; it was more like a huge picnic than a protest rally. They brought food, their children, even their dogs. There was a lot of laughter and optimism. By the time they moved out the marchers were singing.&#x201d;<br>His voice dropped to a harsh whisper. &#x201c;When they reached the Rossville Flats area the British soldiers trapped them in those narrow streets and shot them down like dogs. At least thirteen were killed then and there. Scores of others were wounded. I saw it; I saw it all.&#x201d; Barry closed his eyes for a moment; swayed where he stood.<br>Ursula put out a hand to steady him. He brushed it away. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m all right,&#x201d; he insisted.<br>His mother sat down on the bed. Running up the stairs after him had left her short of breath. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re already calling it Bloody Sunday,&#x201d; she panted. &#x201c;Like the original Bloody Sunday in 1920, when British forces machine-gunned Irish civilians at a football match. That incident was pretty well hushed up, but what happened yesterday is a different story. Television around the world is carrying scenes from Derry.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Bless the telly,&#x201d; rasped Barry. &#x201c;For once the Brits can&#x2019;t pretend one of their atrocities never happened.&#x201d;<br>He leaned the rifle against the wall and slumped onto the bed beside his mother. Ursula waited. Slowly, inch by inch, his spine straightened. When he spoke again his tone was that of a professional observer. &#x201c;When I went to Derry I didn&#x2019;t expect a massacre, Ursula, though maybe I should have. Maybe we all should have. Surely by now we know the imperial mentality.<br>&#x201c;Remember when Martin Luther King gathered a quarter of a million people at the U.S. Capitol in support of civil rights for his people? What a splendid day that was. The whole world seemed new, as if chains were finally being broken and anything was possible. The Catholics in Northern Ireland took King&#x2019;s message to heart. They believed the same nonviolent protest could work for them.<br>&#x201c;They were wrong.<br>&#x201c;Yesterday they staged a peaceful march for their civil rights, and were shot in cold blood by the very army that was supposed to protect them. That&#x2019;s justice in the United Kingdom. In 1960 the American people elected a Catholic president. In 1972 Catholics in Northern Ireland can&#x2019;t even get a decent job.&#x201d; Barry&#x2019;s voice remained steady. Yet tremors of outrage ran through his body.<br>His mother longed to take him in her arms and comfort him. Theirs had never been that sort of relationship, however. His rumpled hair was the same red-gold it had been when he was a boy, but the sleeves of his coat were stained with someone else&#x2019;s blood.<br>He drew a long, deep breath. Exhaled slowly. Drew another. Sought the quiet pool at the centre of himself, which alone could armour a man against the shocks of life.<br>When he got to his feet, Ursula tilted her head back to look up into his face. Jutting cheekbones and aquiline nose; a wide, mobile mouth. Sharply etched lines that made him appear older than his thirty-three years.<br>In his deep-set grey eyes she glimpsed the flash of swords.<br>Barry Halloran looked dangerous.<br>&#x201c;What are you going to do now?&#x201d; she wanted to know.<br>&#x201c;Go up to Dublin.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not now surely. You must be in shock, you need a hot meal and some sleep.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need either one, Ursula; I need to go to Dublin.&#x201d;<br>Total surrender was not in her nature. &#x201c;At least take a cup of strong tea first. Wash your face, have a shave . . . and leave your grandfather&#x2019;s rifle with me. After yesterday, the Gardai* will be out in full strength. You could be stopped anywhere, and if they took Papa&#x2019;s rifle from you we&#x2019;d never get it back.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t worry, they won&#x2019;t stop me. I know every back road between here and Dublin, I&#x2019;ll be there by teatime.&#x201d;<br>So everything&#x2019;s already decided, Ursula thought. I should have known it the moment I saw him holding the rifle.<br>The rifle was a short magazine Lee-Enfield .303 made during World War One, and fitted with a small brass plate proclaiming its place of manufacture: &#x201c;Winchester Repeating Arms Co., New Haven, Connecticut.&#x201d; Ursula Halloran, who knew things, had a bad feeling about that weapon.<br>For years she had expected her beloved papa would die with the Lee-Enfield in his hands. Much to everyone&#x2019;s surprise, Ned Halloran had lived to die in his bed. Before age and his many wounds finally caught up with him he gave the rifle to his daughter and made her promise to pass it on to Barry when the boy reached his fifteenth birthday. When Barry later ran away to follow in his grandfather&#x2019;s footsteps and join the Irish Republican Army, he took the rifle with him.<br>&#x201c;I really would feel better if you left Papa&#x2019;s rifle here this time, Barry,&#x201d; Ursula said. &#x201c;For my protection.&#x201d;<br>He looked down at the small thin woman with her cap of silver hair. And her fierce, blue-grey eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d pity anyone who was fool enough to attack you, Ursula. You&#x2019;re never unarmed. After I took up photography I gave your old Mauser back to you; I suspect it&#x2019;s under your pillow this very minute. And there&#x2019;s always the shotgun in the barn. But I&#x2019;m taking the rifle. After yesterday every Volunteer* in the country will be digging up his weapons. I&#x2019;m sure S�amus has already retrieved his.&#x201d;<br>I should have known, thought Ursula. S�amus. That&#x2019;s why he&#x2019;s in such a hurry to get to Dublin. Who else would he turn to at a time like this?<br>S�amus McCoy had been Barry&#x2019;s training officer in the IRA. Barry had never known his father, who was killed in 1941 when German bombs were dumped on Dublin&#x2019;s North Strand. S�amus McCoy had never had a son. The experienced soldier had given the raw youngster an unspoken paternal affection. Their relationship answered a deep need in both men.<br>In his youth Barry had dreamed of being a warrior in the ancient Celtic mould. He was a natural athlete with more energy than he could use; the IRA had provided an outlet for both. But the first time he saw men killed in front of him the gap between romantic imagination and bloody reality had shaken him to the core.<br>Eventually Barry had disengaged himself from active service. He never discussed the reason for his decision with anyone, even S�amus McCoy. Yet he remained committed to Irish republicanism. While other Volunteers struggled to keep the resistance movement alive by fighting skirmishes and throwing bombs&#x2014;sometimes blowing themselves up instead of RUC stations&#x2020;&#x2014;Barry had turned to freelance photojournalism as a way of furthering the republican viewpoint.<br>&#x201c;I like cameras,&#x201d; was his offhand explanation for his career choice, &#x201c;because I&#x2019;m good at fiddley things like adjusting f-stops.&#x201d; It went deeper than that. Photography suited his complex nature.<br>Barry Halloran had always been a puzzle to those who knew him. As a boy he was reckless and fun-loving, yet given to long silences. His nature combined a fiery temper with a sense of poetry. In a single day he might go from infectious gaiety to brooding melancholy and back again; even his mother was never sure what her child was thinking.<br>Maturity had taught him to keep a lid on his more extreme emotions. Photography provided a creative outlet for those feelings. An inspired moment behind the camera could give voice to the griefs hidden in Barry&#x2019;s heart, or expose an injustice that enraged him.<br>Photojournalism was in its infancy in Ireland, however, so in order to augment an uncertain income, Barry had borrowed enough money to purchase a boardinghouse. At the time he bought the house, in an area of Dublin called Harold&#x2019;s Cross, there were eight boarders; unmarried men with steady jobs who, for the most part, paid their rent on time.<br>&#x201c;I never thought I&#x2019;d become a landlord, when the Irish have hated landlords for centuries,&#x201d; Barry commented wryly.<br>Then, when S�amus McCoy was diagnosed with cancer, Barry had taken him in. He saw his friend through painful surgery and a long convalescence, then persuaded him to stay on at the boardinghouse as manager. Harold&#x2019;s Cross was a growing enterprise.<br>The other member of the staff was a vivacious young American, Barbara Kavanagh, a granddaughter of Ursula&#x2019;s beloved Uncle Henry. Barbara had been in Italy studying to be an opera singer when her voice was damaged by an overzealous teacher. Instead of returning to America she had stayed in Europe and attempted to build a less demanding musical career. In her na�ivet� the girl was mercilessly exploited. At last, angry and disillusioned, she arrived in Dublin. Barry had offered her a safe haven until she got back on her feet.<br>Barbara was still in Harold&#x2019;s Cross, where she was now the housekeeper to pay her way. There was no denying she was an asset. She handled a multiplicity of tasks with typical American efficiency.<br>Ursula was not fooled by the title of &#x201c;housekeeper.&#x201d; Plenty of priests have housekeepers who take care of more than the parochial house, she reminded herself. She had a dark suspicion that someday her son would marry Barbara Kavanagh, and a darker suspicion that it would be a mistake. A headstrong and egocentric young woman, Barbara was far from the traditional model of an Irish wife. And though he would never admit it, in his heart of hearts Barry was a traditional man.<br>His mother was the rebel.<br>When she followed Barry outside she noticed that he was limping. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a long drive to Dublin,&#x201d; she said.<br>He patted his car as she would pat the neck of a horse. &#x201c;Apollo will take care of me.&#x201d; He loved the car, which owed its nickname to the U.S. space programme. Space travel interested Barry. A lot of things interested Barry.<br>She watched him stow the rifle and two boxes of cartridges in the boot of the car and cover them with photographic equipment. The length of his folded tripods was sufficient to conceal a rifle barrel.<br>Barry slammed the lid of the boot and walked to the front of the car. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll see you when I see you,&#x201d; he said casually.<br>&#x201c;What do you think will happen now?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ursula, you know as well as I do the IRA won&#x2019;t take this lying down. The Army&#x2019;s not the force it once was, but the Brits can&#x2019;t shoot innocent Irish people and walk away. Not anymore.&#x201d; A muscle twitched in hi...</p><h2>Spymaster: Startling Cold War Revelations of a Soviet KGB Chief</h2><p>From the dark days of World War II through the Cold War, Sergey A. Kondrashev was a major player in Russia&#x2019;s notorious KGB espionage apparatus. Rising through its ranks through hard work and keen understanding of how the spy and political games are played, he &#x201c;handled&#x201d; American and British defectors, recruited Western operatives as double agents, served as a ranking officer at the East Berlin and Vienna KGB bureaus, and tackled special assignments from the Kremlin.<br><br>During a 1994 television program about former spymasters, Kondrashev met and began a close friendship with a former foe, ex&#x2013;CIA officer Tennent H. &#x201c;Pete&#x201d; Bagley, whom the Russian asked to help write his memoirs.<br>Because Bagley knew so about much of Kondrashev&#x2019;s career (they had been on opposite sides in several operations), his penetrating questions and insights reveal slices of never-revealed espionage history that rival anything found in the pages of Ian Fleming, Len Deighton, or John le Carr�: chilling tales of surviving Stalin&#x2019;s purges while superiors and colleagues did not, of plotting to reveal the Berlin Tunnel, of quelling the Hungarian Revolution and &#x201c;Prague Spring&#x201d; independence movements, and of assisting in arranging the final disposition of the corpses of Adolf Hitler and Eva Braun. Kondrashev also details equally fascinating KGB propaganda and disinformation efforts that shaped Western attitudes throughout the Cold War.<br><br>Because publication of these memoirs was banned by Putin&#x2019;s regime, Bagley promised Kondrashev to have them published in the West. They are now available to all who are fascinated by vivid tales of international intrigue.</p><p><strong>Tennent H. Bagley</strong> served for twenty-two years in the Central Intelligence Agency, where he handled spies and defectors in the clandestine services division before becoming chief of Soviet bloc counterintelligence. The author of <em>Spy Wars: Moles, Mysteries, and Deadly Games</em>, Bagley lives in Brussels, Belgium.&#x201c;Fans of spy nonfiction, prepare to get giddy with excitement. Not only does this book draw on the previously unpublished memoirs of a veteran Russian intelligence operative, Sergey Kondrashev, it&#x2019;s written by a veteran CIA operative. . . . Although the inner workings of Cold War&#x2013;era Russian intelligence have been written about before, mostly in spy novels, this may be most readers&#x2019; first exposure to this material in a real-world setting. Kondrashev&#x2019;s adventures&#x2014;including his key role in the suppression of the Hungarian Revolution and his relationship with George Blake, the MI6 agent who, in the 1950s, was secretly passing information to the KGB&#x2014;don&#x2019;t spring from a writer&#x2019;s imagination. This stuff actually happened.

Thus begins a great classic of children's literature that we all remember as magical. What we tend to forget, because the tale of Peter Pan and Neverland has been so relentlessly boiled down, hashed up, and coated in saccharine, is that J.M. Barrie's original version is also witty, sophisticated, and delightfully odd. The Darling children, Wendy, John, and Michael, live a very proper middle-class life in Edwardian London, but they also happen to have a Newfoundland for a nurse. The text is full of such throwaway gems as "Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter Pan when she was tidying up her children's minds," and is peppered with deliberately obscure vocabulary including "embonpoint," "quietus," and "pluperfect." Lest we forget, it was written in 1904, a relatively innocent age in which a plot about abducted children must have seemed more safely fanciful. Also, perhaps, it was an age that expected more of its children's books, for <i>Peter Pan</i> has a suppleness, lightness, and intelligence that are "literary" in the best sense. In a typical exchange with the dastardly Captain Hook, Peter Pan describes himself as "youth... joy... a little bird that has broken out of the egg," and the author interjects: "This, of course, was nonsense; but it was proof to the unhappy Hook that Peter did not know in the least who or what he was, which is the very pinnacle of good form." A book for adult readers-aloud to revel in--and it just might teach young listeners to fly.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland.Claudine Burroughs did not look forward to the party. This November of 1868 it had been bitterly cold, the kind of chill that creeps into one&#x2019;s bones and makes them ache. Now it was early December and warm again. People were predicting the mild spell would last. Here in London there might not even be any snow! Most unseasonal.<br><br>Claudine regarded her face in the glass, not because she admired it, but because she must do the best with it that she could. She had never been pretty, and now in middle age she had not even the bloom of earlier years. She had strength, something not always admired in a woman; and character, also not necessarily cared for; but excellent hair, thick, shining, and with a natural wave. When her maid dressed it in a glamorous style, as she had this evening, it always stayed exactly where she wished. It was the one aspect of her appearance in which her husband, Wallace, had ever expressed his pleasure.<br><br>Not that that mattered to her anymore. He disapproved of too much that was at the core of her, like answering honestly when she was asked her political opinions&#x2014;�which were definitely more radical than most people&#x2019;s. She laughed at the jokes it would have been more ladylike to pretend not to understand. And, despite Wallace&#x2019;s disapproval, she worked at Hester Monk&#x2019;s clinic for sick or injured prostitutes&#x2014;�voluntarily, of course; she had no need of money, and the clinic had none to offer. She had begun there looking for something better to fill her time with than endless committees. Now she loved it for the fellowship, the variety, and above all, the sense that she was doing something of genuine worth.<br><br>She looked away from the glass. There was nothing more to accomplish here. She stood up and, thanking her maid, went out onto the landing and down the stairs, walking carefully so as not to trip over the hem of her rich teal-�green gown.<br><br>Wallace was standing in the hall with his coat on. He was a big man, more overweight than his expensive and skillfully cut suits allowed to show. The flicker of impatience on his heavy features told her that she had kept him waiting.<br><br>He made no remark, no compliment on her appearance, simply held her cape for her and then nodded to the footman as he followed her out of the front door. Their carriage had drawn up to the curb ready for them. The coachman must have known the address to which they were going because Wallace did not offer him any directions.<br><br>They did not speak on the journey. They had long ago run out of things to say to each other about life or feelings, and Claudine imagined he did not want to pretend any more than she did. There would be enough of that when they arrived. The other guests were all socially important, which was the reason for their going. Wallace was a successful investment adviser to several people of considerable importance, and she admitted that he deserved his success. Apart from being gifted, he worked very hard at cultivating all the right connections. He never failed in anything he regarded as his duty. It was the laughter, the gentleness, and the imagination he could not manage. Perhaps it was beyond his ability, as well as his nature. During rare moments, she hoped he was happier in their life than he had ever made her.<br><br>And yet, it would be graceless not to acknowledge that she had never gone without any of the physical comforts of life. She had never dreaded that a letter or a knock on the door would be a request to pay a debt she could not meet. He had never lied to her, so far as she was aware, never drank too much, never embarrassed her in public, and certainly had never been unfaithful. She sometimes thought she might have understood if he had been, possibly even forgiven him for it. It would have shown a quality of passion she had never felt him to possess. Instead of admiring his rigid tidiness, it infuriated her. He folded everything, even the discarded newspaper, matching the corners exactly. He put everything away where it belonged as soon as he finished using it.<br><br>But that was a self-�defeating argument. If he had understood passion and loneliness, the same desperate hunger for warmth, then she might have loved him, despite everything else. She had tried to love him. But here they were.<br><br>At least she could behave with gratitude. She would do her part this evening: She would be gracious to the Foxleys and the Crostwicks, the Halversgates and the Giffords, and everyone else it was necessary to please.<br><br>They alighted at the entrance to the Giffords&#x2019; magnificent house. Forbes and Oona Gifford were wealthy enough to entertain in the most lavish style, and seating thirty to dinner was no effort to their staff. Claudine and Wallace were welcomed into the hall, relieved of their outer clothing, and shown into the first of the large reception rooms. They had timed it perfectly: not the last to arrive, which would be slightly ill-�mannered or self-�important, but very far from first, which made one appear overeager.<br><br>Oona was Forbes&#x2019;s second wife, his first having died some ten years earlier. No one knew where Oona had lived before their marriage, and she never mentioned it, which was an interesting omission. She was very striking to look at, some might say truly beautiful. She came toward Wallace and Claudine now, her dark hair swept up luxuriantly and her slender gown the height of fashion. Wide crinolines were suddenly out. No one with the slightest pretensions to style would be seen in one.<br><br>&#x201c;Delightful of you to come,&#x201d; Oona said with a smile. &#x201c;Thank you, so much. In spite of the clemency of the weather, Christmas will be upon us before we know it. Let us begin to celebrate as soon as we can, I say.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; Wallace agreed, forcing a warmth Claudine knew he did not mean. &#x201c;What better way to begin the season?&#x201d; He spotted Nigel Halversgate and moved toward him, realizing Nigel was standing with his wife, Charlotte&#x2014;�known as Tolly&#x2014;�only when it was too late to change course.<br><br>Oona saw what had happened and shot a surprisingly candid look of amusement at Claudine.<br><br>&#x201c;Beginning to gain the Christmas spirit, I see,&#x201d; Oona said ambiguously.<br><br>&#x201c;Such a party is definitely the best place to do so,&#x201d; Claudine replied, equally ambiguously. She was thinking of the discipline it took to be agreeable to a number of people she did not know very well or especially care for, but she certainly would not say so aloud.<br><br>&#x201c;Goodwill to all men,&#x201d; Oona murmured under her breath. She sighed. &#x201c;And women.&#x201d; Lifting her chin a little, she turned as Euphemia Crostwick approached, a delicately blond woman whose pretty face was always at attention, looking this way and that to be sure she missed nothing.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you know Mrs. Burroughs,&#x201d; Oona said, motioning toward Claudine.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course.&#x201d; Eppy Crostwick smiled brightly. She looked up and down at Claudine&#x2019;s dress; it was a very handsome one, but it certainly would have overwhelmed her own diminutive figure, and its dramatic coloring would have bleached her skin. &#x201c;It seems like ages since we last met,&#x201d; she added, letting the underlying meaning hang in the air.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed.&#x201d; Claudine inclined her head, her good intentions already vanished. &#x201c;So much has happened. But surely it is one of the pleasures of life to be busy, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Eppy&#x2019;s eyes widened. &#x201c;I had no idea you were . . . busy. Your charities, no doubt . . . You must tell me all about it&#x201d;&#x2014;�she waved her hand delicately&#x2014;�&#x201c;sometime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course,&#x201d; Claudine agreed. &#x201c;I should be happy to. However, this is an evening to celebrate our own good fortune, rather than commiserate about the tragedies of others.&#x201d;<br><br>Eppy gave a sigh of relief, which was only a trifle forced. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure you&#x2019;d love to meet some of the other people here. You know Verena Foxley, of course. Such a good-�looking boy, Creighton, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>They all looked over at the Foxleys. Claudine did agree that Creighton Foxley was handsome enough, if not quite as superb as he himself imagined&#x2014;�but then, Eppy had not really meant it to be a question. It was an opening for Claudine, who had no children herself&#x2014;�another way in which she had disappointed Wallace&#x2014;�to argue that Eppy&#x2019;s son, Cecil, was just as distinguished, in his own way. Actually, Cecil was very ordinary looking, but one did not say such things, for Cecil and Creighton were good friends. Occasionally Ernest Hal�versgate tagged along with them, half disapproving most of the time but reluctant to say so in case he found himself excluded.<br><br>Claudine took a deep breath. &#x201c;Very handsome, in a certain way,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;But there are others perhaps a little more . . . interesting to look at, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d; She smiled as she said it, allowing her implication to be understood.<br><br>Eppy was satisfied. &#x201c;I do so agree. Have you heard that Lady Lyall is to be married . . . again? The woman is quite . . .&#x201d; She searched for a word.<br><br>&#x201c;Extraordinary,&#x201d; Claudine supplied. It was the perfect cover-�all word for disapproval that could never be quoted against you. Its entire meaning depended upon the expression with which you said it, the degree of uplift in the voice.<br><br>And so the early part of the evening progressed: a series of encounters with people Claudine had met on scores of other such occasions, from a world she used to be part of. But since her work in the clinic and her introduction to a different reality, it felt more alien than ever. Did she look as strange and lost as she felt? The thought occurred to her that perhaps everyone felt the same, in their own way; as if each of them were trapped in his or her own little bubble, jostling and bumping with others but never breaking through.<br><br>No, that was complete nonsense. There was Tolly Halversgate, elegant in the extreme of fashion, wearing a shade of purple-�pink no one else would get away with. She was imparting some confidence to an elderly woman Claudine knew had a title of some sort, but she could not remember what. Countess or marchioness of somewhere. Tolly was a great royalist, always looking upward.<br><br>Lambert Foxley was talking business with a couple of hearty men at least ten years older than he. Both of them nodded to emphasize a point.<br><br>A couple of girls laughed just a shade too loudly, attracting the disapproval of their mothers, and the interest of several young men.<br><br>It was all colored silk, chatter, the glitter of lights from chandeliers, and lots of laughter.<br><br>Instead of mingling her way through the crowd again, as Wallace would have expected of her, Claudine turned away and walked through a garden room. At the far side she opened the French doors onto the terrace and stepped out. It was extraordinarily pleasant: a wide paved area extending all the way to the wall bordering the street. There were flower beds&#x2014;�bare now, of course, but no doubt full of daffodils or hyacinths come spring. There were also ornamental stone tubs at different heights, giving a most agreeable variety, and several attractive holly bushes. The terrace was overlooked by the windows of at least two of the neighboring houses, but they were all dark, leaving Claudine with an agreeable sense of solitude.<br><br>It was at that exact moment she realized with a jolt that she was not actually alone. Half in the shadows between the soft glow from the Giffords&#x2019; lighted windows, there was a man standing watching her. For an instant she was frightened. Then, when she realized he could only have come from the party, since there was no other way to reach the terrace, she was merely annoyed.<br><br>&#x201c;Good evening, sir,&#x201d; she said coldly. &#x201c;I apologize if I am interrupting you. I did not see you in the shadows.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t greatly wish to be seen,&#x201d; he replied. His voice was very deep and a little slurred, and yet there was a music in it, a lilt even in those few words. &#x201c;Then I should have to make polite, inane conversation,&#x201d; he added.<br><br>She herself was not in the mood to be polite, or inane. Her eyes were becoming accustomed to the half-�light now, and she could see him more clearly. He was of average height, which meant only an inch or two taller than she. It was hard to tell his age. His heavy hair was dense black, with not a touch of gray, even at the temples, but his face was ravaged by some inner wasting. His dark eyes were ringed with what looked like bruises, and his cheeks were blotched and sunken. His features were strong, his mouth generous, but already either disease or drink had marred him.<br><br>&#x201c;That is what parties are for,&#x201d; she said, still coolly. &#x201c;Polite conversation. What were you expecting?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Just one person who can see the stars,&#x201d; he replied, apparently not stung by her tone. &#x201c;And you never know where you&#x2019;ll find them.&#x201d;<br><br>She recognized the music in his voice now. He was a Welshman, probably long left the valleys but never quite forgotten them. Surprising herself, she answered him honestly.<br><br>&#x201c;No, you don&#x2019;t, but they are more likely to be found among those who are searching than those who would get a crick in their necks if they looked upward.&#x201d; She wished at once she had not said it. It sounded more judgmental than she had intended.<br><br>He laughed. It was a sound of pure pleasure.<br><br>&#x201c;Well spoken, Mrs. . . . never mind, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. You will tell me your name and I&#x2019;ll think it doesn&#x2019;t suit. I shall call you Olwen . . .&#x201d;<br><br>She was about to object, then she realized that she liked the name better than her own. She wanted to ask him why he had chosen it, and perhaps what it meant, but that would have betrayed far too much interest.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed,&#x201d; she said quietly. &#x201c;And what shall I call you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dai Tregarron,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;I would say &#x2018;at your service,&#x2019; but I do little of use. Poet, philosopher, and deep drinker of life . . . and of a good deal of fine whiskey, when I can find it. And I should add, a lover of beauty, whether it be in a note of music, a sunset spilling its blood across the sky, or a beautiful woman. I am regarded as something of a blasphemer by society, and they enjoy the frisson of horror they indulge in when mentioning my name. Of course, I disagree, violently. To me, the one true blasphemy is ingratitude, calling God&#x2019;s great, rich world a thing of no value. It is of infinite value, so precious it breaks your heart, so fleeting that eternity is merely a beginning.&#x201d; His bold stare demanded she answer.</p><h2>How Would You Survive in the Middle Ages (How Would You Survive Ser)</h2><p>Describes medieval daily life, families, food, clothing, health, education, work, entertainment, government, travel, warfare, customs, and beliefs in Europe.</p><p></p><h2>In the Beginning: Foundations of Creation Theology</h2><p>Recent discussions of creation have centered on the skirmishes between creationists and evolutionists. However, as the editor of this volume points out, there is much more to the Christian doctrine of creation than scientific battles about origins and the age of the earth. <p>To Herman Bavinck, the doctrine of creation, affirming the distinction between the Creator and his creature, is the starting point of true religion. Though Bavincks In the Beginning contains relevant treatments of frequently addressed topics, such as evolution, Darwinism, and the age of humanity, it also broadens the theological discussion of creation by exploring other elements of this essential doctrine, including angels and the spiritual world, the image of God in humans, the destiny of creation and humanity, and Gods providential care over creation. </p><p>Herman Bavinck stands as one of historys finest Reformed theologians, yet his writings are only now being made available in English. In the Beginning: Foundations of Creation Theology is the second installment in the Dutch Reformed Translation Societys translation of Bavincks classic Gereformeerde Dogmatiek (Reformed Dogmatics). The first installment is The Last Things.</p></p><p>Herman Bavinck (18541921) taught theology at the Theological School in Kampen, The Netherlands, and at the Free University of Amsterdam for almost forty years. At the Free University he succeeded the famous theologian and politician Abraham Kuyper. Among Bavincks most influential publications were Reformed Dogmatics and Our Reasonable Faith. <p>John Bolt is professor of theology at Calvin Theological Seminary, an editor of Calvin Theological Journal, and executive editor of the Dutch Reformed Translation Society. John Vriend has been a full-time translator since 1982. Among the authors he has translated are G. C. Berkouwer and Hendrikus Berkhof.</p>As a Calvinistic geologist, Ive wanted all my professional life to know what Bavinck had to say about the biblical doctrine of creation and its implications for the historical natural sciences, like geology, astronomy, and paleontology. What a treat at last to read his perceptive and carefully nuanced treatment of the doctrine of creation... Bavinck displays remarkable familiarity with the scientific currents of his time, and even though his understanding of turn-of-the-century geology is partially flawed, his analysis of the issues of the antiquity of the Earth, evolution, the deluge, death before the Fall, and the nature of humans is, nevertheless, full of important insights. Because geology, biology, astronomy, and biblical studies have considerably advanced since Bavincks day, readers may not agree in every instance with his positions, but they will always be enriched and challenged by his carefully balanced discussions of the issues. -- <i>Davis A. Young, professor of geology, Calvin College</i><br><br>This is a theological feast! Bavinck was a first-rate theologian who speaks here to issues that are as timely today as they were a century ago. Theological reflection on the nature and scope of Gods creating work does not get any better than this. -- <i>Richard J. Mouw</i></p><h2>The Heiress</h2><p>Cast 3 M, 6 F. The background of the play is New York in the 1850s and the basic story tells of a shy and plain young girl, Catherine Sloper, who falls desperately in love with a delightful young fortune hunter. Catherine&#39;s lack of worldliness prevents her from realizing that the young man proposing to her is not entirely drawn to her by her charm. Catherine&#39;s father, a successful doctor, sees through the fortune hunter and forbids the marriage, but his daughter proposes an elopement that fails to materialize because the young man knows most of her expected fortune will go elsewhere if he marries her. Catherine retires into a little world of her own. But the fortune hunter turns up once more and again proposes to her. For a moment, Catherine leads him to believe that she will accept him, but when he calls by appointment, she locks the door, blows out all the lights and allows him to realize that she will not be fooled for the second time.</p><p></p><h2>Meditations</h2><p>Meditations is a series of personal writings by Marcus Aurelius, Roman Emperor 161&#x2013;180 CE, setting forth his ideas on Stoic philosophy.Marcus Aurelius wrote the 12 books of the Meditations in Koine Greek as a source for his own guidance and self-improvement. It is possible that large portions of the work were written at Sirmium, where he spent much time planning military campaigns from 170 to 180. Some of it was written while he was positioned at Aquincum on campaign in Pannonia, because internal notes tell us that the second book was written when he was campaigning against the Quadi on the river Granova (modern-day Hron) and the third book was written at Carnuntum. It is not clear that he ever intended the writings to be published, so the title Meditations is but one of several commonly assigned to the collection. These writings take the form of quotations varying in length from one sentence to long paragraphs.</p><p><b>Marcus Aurelius</b> was born in 121 AD. He was the Roman emperor between 161 AD and 180 AD. His Meditations are our closest link to Ancient Stoicism and its practices. <br><b>George Long</b> was an English scholar and translator in the early-to-mid-1800s. In addition to Meditations, his translation works include Plutarch s <i>Lives</i> as well as <i>Discourses of Epictetus</i>. He was an avid member of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge and edited their quarterly magazine entitled <i>Journal of Education</i>. <br><b>Carolyn Gregoire</b> is a senior writer at the <b>Huffington Post</b>. Her focus areas include human behavior, psychology, and neuroscience. Her work has been featured in the <i>New Republic, Time</i> magazine, <i>Scientific American</i>, among other publications.

On February 17, 1864, after a legendary encounter with a Union battleship, the iron &#x201c;fish boat&#x201d; vanished without a trace somewhere off the coast of South Carolina. For more than a century the fate of the <i>Hunley</i> remained one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Civil War. Then, on August 8, 2000, with thousands of spectators crowding Charleston Harbor, the <i>Hunley</i> was raised from the bottom of the sea and towed ashore. Now, award-winning journalists Brian Hicks and Schuyler Kropf offer new insights into the <i>Hunley</i>&#x2019;s final hours and recount the amazing true story of its rescue.<br><br>The brainchild of wealthy New Orleans planter and lawyer Horace Lawson Hunley, the <i>Hunley</i> inspired tremendous hopes of breaking the Union&#x2019;s naval blockade of Charleston, only to drown two crews on disastrous test runs. But on the night of February 17, 1864, the <i>Hunley</i> finally made good on its promise. Under the command of the heroic Lieutenant George E. Dixon, the sub rammed a spar torpedo into the Union sloop <i>Housatonic</i> and sank the ship within minutes, accomplishing a feat of stealth technology that would not be repeated for half a century.<br><br>And then, shortly after its stunning success, the <i>Hunley</i> vanished.<br><br>This book is an extraordinary true story peopled with a fascinating cast of characters, including Horace Hunley himself, the Union officers and crew who went down with the <i>Housatonic</i>, P. T. Barnum, who offered $100,000 for its recovery, and novelist Clive Cussler, who spearheaded the mission that finally succeeded in finding the <i>Hunley</i>. The drama of salvaging the sub is only the prelude to a page-turning account of how scientists unsealed this archaeological treasure chest and discovered the inner-workings of a submarine more technologically advanced than anyone expected, as well as numerous, priceless artifacts.<br><br>Hicks and Kropf have crafted a spellbinding adventure story that spans over a century of American history.

Along with Agatha Christie&#x2019;s Miss Marple, Miss Silver is the definitive embodiment of the English style of cozy mysteries.<br>&#x201c;Miss Silver has her place in detective fiction as surely as Lord Peter Wimsey or Hercule Poirot.&#x201d; &#x2014;<i>Manchester Evening News </i>&nbsp;&#x201c;Patricia Wentworth has created a great detective in Miss Silver, the little old lady who nobody notices, but who in turn notices everything.&#x201d; &#x2014;Paula Gosling, author of the Jack Stryker mystery series</p><h2>The Anxiety &amp; Phobia Workbook</h2><p><p></p><ul>Practical, step-by-step directions for the mastery of:<li>Visualization</li><li>Self-Esteem</li><li>Nutrition</li><li>Medication</li><li>Meditation techniques</li><li>Anxiety-triggering health conditions</li></ul><p></p><p>Over 600,000 Copies Sold</p><p>Since its first edition in 1990, <b>The Anxiety and Phobia Workbook</b> has sold more than 600,000 copies.

Even libraries that already own Ethan Herberman's The Great Butterfly Hunt (S &amp; S, 1990; o.p.), Kathryn Lasky's Monarchs (Harcourt, 1993), and Bianca Lavies's Monarch Butterflies (Dutton, 1993) need this book. It is written as a story, following the life cycle of a female caterpillar?Danaus?from an egg laid in a Massachusetts hayfield to her death in an Arkansas pasture many months and a fantastic migration later. The narrative is scientifically sound and includes information from the most recent research on these familiar aerial flitterers. The attractive, oversized book is lavished with realistic, full-color paintings of Monarchs in all stages of their development and their habitats. Colorful sidebars and a variety of maps are accompanied by informative captions, and the whole is arranged into a particularly appealing, readable, and accurate package. A modicum of anthropomorphism does occur, but it is infrequent and low-key. An effort to avoid an onrushing car or the state of a heavily gravid female Monarch with no milkweed in sight may well be "frantic," and these slight slippages are unobtrusive. Following the body of the work are chapters on protecting the remaining winter refuges of these feather-light migrants and on raising Monarchs at home or in the classroom. A list of further readings?many of them juvenile titles?and an index complete the harmonious whole.?Patricia Manning, formerly at Eastchester Public Library, NY<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.A migration flight from New England to Mexico and back again would be impressive for a large goose; for a monarch butterfly, it's nothing short of miraculous. Pringle (Smoking, 1996, etc.) and Marstall capture that miracle in this chronicle of the lifetime of a monarch called Danaus (after its Latin name). Readers follow Danaus on her perilous journey from Massachusetts, slipping through cat paws and struggling with bad weather until she and thousands of other monarchs find their winter homes in Mexico and California. Even there, life is dangerous: Cold weather and predators kill off many monarchs before spring arrives, when they mate, fly north, lay their eggs, and die. Pringle writes simply of all the small, fascinating details that make up the monarch's life cycle, while illustrations and captions help readers visualize the information, e.g., that delicate gold dots on a monarch's chrysalis may help disguise the chrysalis from predators by reflecting sunlight like drops of dew, and the caterpillar's markings warn predators that it eats milkweed, making it poisonous to some. Marstall provides nearly photorealistic views of biological processes, but never neglects the poetic aspect of the information. A superb, well-researched book that finds extraordinary science in the everyday life of a butterfly.

One of the most important is the legacy of Dr. Ali Shari'ati (1933-1977). A teacher, scholar and writer, Shari'ati and a dynamic influence on the young people of Iran with his classes, discussions, free lectures and articles during the 1960's and 1970's. <p>Shari'ati was a sociologist, educated in Mashhad and Paris, as well as a student of history and philosophy. He subjected contemporary society to careful examination, using the terms, experiences and concepts found in Islamic philosophy and culture for his analysis. He formulated and presented to his students and readers a coherent Islamic world-view and an ideology of social, political and economic change. His views have contributed much to the Iranian Islamic revolution. </p><p>Shari'ati works are constantly reprinted and eagerly studies through-out Iran. This anthology is the first systematic presentation in English of some of his major ideas.</p></p><p>Hamid Algar, the translator was born in 1940 in England and studied Arabic and Persian languages and Islamic Studies at Cambridge University.

An interesting subject, of course, but also one that is treated with both fairness and depth, placing that figure in the richness of his or her historical context. In this way we get all the pleasures of a good story along with the delight of learning. This is what Bernard Cottret accomplishes in his biography of John Calvin, now translated into English from the French. More historian than theologian, Cottret brings a useful objectivity to this study. In doing so the book reminds us of the fascination of subjects we might too easily consider merely academic. Immensely influential in his own time (and in our own, almost 500 years later), this biography gives us the story of Calvin's life in its historical context and a succinct analysis of his theology. It appropriately detours in order to remind the reader of the context in which Calvin was growing up: brief explorations of the Renaissance and the Protestant Reformation, for example, remind us that these were not simply subjects in school in the early 1500's. As Cottret notes, Calvin turned 21 in 1530: what would it mean to be an immensely gifted and driven young man at such a time in Europe? It's a great question to ask, and in this book Cottret answers it with style and depth. <i>--Doug Thorpe</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>The Mortal Messiah: from Bethlehem to Calvary: Book 4</h2><p>Volume Four of this four volume serious of the life an ministry of Jesus Christ. &#34;Come learn of me,&#34; the Savior invites. &#34;Learn of me, and listen to my words; walk in the meekness of my Spirit, and you shall have peace in me. I am Jesus Christ; I came by the will of the Father, and I do his will.&#34; These words, spoken by the Savior in ancient and modern times, provide the challenge with which Elder Bruce R. McConkie of the Council of the Twelve Apostles, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, begins this four-volume work on the mortal life and ministry of the Lord Jesus Christ. Who was Jesus of Nazareth? What was his mission? What do we know of his birth, his early life, and his ministry? Who were his disciples? What were the conditions in Palestine in the Meridian of Time, when he walked the earth and mingled with men?

Art History, Theory &amp; Criticism. "In this wonderfully bold and speculative anthology of writings, artists and critics offer a highly persuasive set of argument and pleas for imaginative, socially responsible, and socially responsive public art.... This book will prove as valuable to art and cultural historians and critics as it will be to public policy makers, students and a diverse public audience"&#x2014;Moira Roth, Mills College. "Energized by ideas and experiences in performance art, community art, installation, social history, and urban planning, artists are creating and invigorating new public art that imbues daily life with meaning and significance"&#x2014;Richard Andrews, University of Washington.</p><p>Editor Suzanne Lacy is an internationally known conceptual/performance artist whose complex performances address significant social issues and engage local populations in a place-specific manner. Lacy&#39;s background is in psychology and community organizing. Since the early seventies, her work has explored themes of violence, oppression, racism, and homelessness. A founding member of the Feminist Studio Workshop at the Woman&#39;s Building in Los Angeles, Lacy pioneered the exploration of art as a force in the community and within the media. Lacy is a prolific analytical writer on feminist performance-art theory. Her writing explores areas in which art and &#34;real life&#34; interface with and change each other. For twenty years her art and writing have advocated activism, audience engagement, and artists&#39; role in shaping the public agenda. She was a Guggenheim Fellow in 1993. Lacy currently teaches performance and new genre art at the California College of Arts and Crafts, in Oakland, where she is dean of fine arts.Edited by Suzanne Lacy, a Bay Area artist and theorist, the collection is the first to attempt such a comprehensive look at the field. Indeed, the sheer scope of consideration is breathtaking at times, and the contributors convincingly provide a collective framework for art events as various as billboard art and fifties Happenings, mural projects and parks implemented by urban planners, site-specific sculptures, and ritual dances. Artists as varied as Judy Chicago, Christo, Ant Farm, the Guerrilla Girls and Mujeres Muralistas are considered. The book breaks ground, however, in its effort to provoke, disturb and disrupt the reader's sense of where, exactly, the boundaries between life and art are drawn. Whereas much public art criticism is descriptive, the contributors to this volume concentrate on articulating "where we are and where we're going" (Lucy R. Lippard), and all participated in the creation of the compendium which lists individual artists and describes specific works. The attempt is less to map out, survey or contain than it is to devise critical strategies and theoretical and practical approaches to this dramatically expanding field -- <i>Artweek, April, 1995</i><br><br>In original essays, well-known critics and artists (among them Lucy Lippard, Arlene Raven, Suzi Gablik, and Guillermo Gomez-Pena) explore what happens when artists directly engage and address "real-world" audiences in various public sites and use public art as an instrument of public change. Included is a valuable illustrated compendium of ninety pioneering artists who, for nearly twenty years, have been perfecting an artistic aesthetic based not on similarities of medium but on shared methods, purpose, and intent. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i><br><br>Mapping the Terrain: New Genre Public Art, edited by Lacy, fuels the emerging critical discourse in public art and begins to define a new style of art production. The text includes 12 essays by important artists, curators and critics, as well as a compendium of the work of over 90 artists. Many of the essays included in this text speak out strongly against Modernist claims of authorship and individuality. Historical notions of a passive audience viewing large-scale sculpture in plazas, what Lucy Lippard refers to as "plunk art," are challenged by new genre public art. By interacting with the audience in participatory events that intend to build community, many have questioned whether the result is actually art or social work.....Mapping the Terrain seeks to firmly place this type of activity in an art context and calls for a re-evaluation of existing definitions of art. Particularly noteworthy in this regard are the essays by Suzi Gablik, Patricia Phillips, Lippard and Jeff Kelley --<i>Afterimage, Summer, 1996</i></p><h2>Csardas</h2><p>CSARDAS - taken from the name of the Hungarian national dance - follows the fortunes of the enchanting Ferenc sisters from their glittering beginnings in aristocratic Hungary, through the traumas of two World Wars.From the dazzling elegance of coming-out balls, feudal estates and a culture steeped in romance, to terror and starvation in the concentration camps - no story could be more dramatic than that of Eva and Amalia Ferenc, whose fate it is to be debutantes when the shot which killed Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo plunged Europe into the First World War.

My tights are rolled like sushi, my tabletops are bare, my kitchen is so clean I could perform surgery in it. But I wasn&#x2019;t always this way. When I was twenty-three, I left my New York City apartment with a panty liner stuck to my back.<br><br> Yes, it was used. Yes, earlier that day, I&#x2019;d taken it off and tossed it onto my twin bed like a bear throws salmon bones onto a rock. Once it was there, I guess I forgot about it. It was probably camouflaged. I promise you there was other stuff on the bed. My bed used to look like a landfill.<br><br> Maybe I threw my coat over it and it stuck. And then I put my coat back on and rode a bus thirty blocks with a panty liner between my shoulder blades. No, nobody said a word. I didn&#x2019;t know it was there until my date gave me a hug and then peeled it off like he was at a burlesque show in hell.<br><br> This was not the man I married. <br><br> The man I married walked into my apartment and found Pop-Tart crusts on my couch. I can still see his face, bewildered and big-eyed, pointing at the crusts as if to ask, &#x201c;Do you see them too?&#x201d; <br><br> I shrugged. <br><br> He sat on the sofa. It is my husband&#x2019;s nature to accept me the way that I am. <br><br> My nature is to leave every cabinet and drawer open like a burglar. My superpower is balancing the most stuff on a bathroom sink. If I had my druthers, I&#x2019;d let cat puke dry on a carpet so it&#x2019;s easier to scrape up. If druthers were things, and I had a coupon for druthers, I&#x2019;d stockpile them like Jell-O because you never know when you might need some druthers. <br><br> My husband fell in love with a creative woman. &#x201c;Cre�ative&#x201d; is Southern Lady Code for <i>slob</i>. <br><br> But it is one thing to accept a slob for who she is; it is another to live with her. <br><br> A year into our marriage, my husband complained. <br><br> He said, &#x201c;Would you mind keeping the dining room table clean? It&#x2019;s the first thing I see when I come home.&#x201d; <br><br> What I heard was: &#x201c;I want a divorce.&#x201d; <br><br> What I said was: &#x201c;Do you want a divorce?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;No,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;I just want a clean table.&#x201d;<br><br> I called my mother.<br><br> Mama asked, &#x201c;What&#x2019;s on the table?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Oh, everything. Whatever comes off my body when I come home. Shopping bags, food, coffee cups, mail.

You married a saint. Clean the goddamned table.&#x201d;<br><br> And so, to save my marriage, I taught myself to clean.<br><br> Not knowing where to start, I knelt before the TV at the Church of Joan Crawford, who said as Mildred Pierce, &#x201c;Never leave one room without something for another.&#x201d;<br><br> Yes, I&#x2019;ll admit she had a temper, but she knew how to clean.<br><br> You scrub a floor on your hands and knees. You shake a can of Comet like a piggy bank. You hang your clothes in your closet a finger&#x2019;s width apart. And no, you do not have wire hangers. Ever. <br><br> I have wooden hangers from the Container Store. They&#x2019;re walnut and cost $7.99 for a pack of six. I bought the hangers online because stepping into the Container Store for me is like stepping into a crack den. See, you&#x2019;re an addict trying to organize your crack, and they&#x2019;re sell�ing you pretty boxes to put your crack in.<br><br> Pretty boxes <i>are </i>crack, so now you have more crack. But wooden hangers are okay. They&#x2019;re like mimosas. Nobody&#x2019;s going to OD on mimosas. Wooden hangers give you a boost of confidence. They make you feel rich and thin. They make a plain white shirt sexy. You promise yourself you&#x2019;ll fill one closet, and then you&#x2019;ll quit. <br><br> But I didn&#x2019;t quit. To keep my buzz going, I asked my husband if I could clean his closet. <br><br> He asked, &#x201c;What does that mean?&#x201d; <br><br> I said, &#x201c;Switch out your plastic hangers for wooden ones. What do you think I mean?&#x201d; <br><br> &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, something new for Saturday night?&#x201d; He did the air quotes: &#x201c;Clean my closet.&#x201d; <br><br> My new ways were so new he assumed I was making sexual advances. It&#x2019;s understandable&#x2014;so much dirty talk sounds so hygienic: salad spinning and putting a teabag on a saucer. It&#x2019;s like Martha Stewart wrote Urban Dic�tionary.<br><br> My husband opened his closet door and stepped aside. The man trusts me. I rehung his closet with military pre�cision.<br><br> He said, &#x201c;I never knew it could be this good.&#x201d;<br><br> We kissed.<br><br> And then I relapsed.<br><br> I don&#x2019;t know how it happened. Maybe it was leaving the Dutch oven to soak overnight. Maybe it was tee-peeing books on my desk like a bonfire. Maybe it was shucking my panties off like shoes. And then my coat fell off the dining room table. And I left it there because the cats were using it as a bed. There it stayed along with laundry, newspapers, restaurant leftovers (that never made it to the fridge), and Zappos returns.<br><br> My husband played hopscotch, never uttering a word of contempt, seemingly okay to coast on the memory of a pristine home as if it had been a once-in-a-lifetime bucket-list thrill like white-water rafting or winning a Pulitzer. Sure, he could have put things away, but every closet except for his was bulging and breathing like a porthole to another dimension.<br><br> I scared myself straight by binge-watching <i>Hoard�ers</i>. What do you mean, that lady couldn&#x2019;t claw her way through her grocery bag &#x201c;collection&#x201d; to give her hus�band CPR?<br><br> So I gave books I had read to libraries. Clothes I hadn&#x2019;t worn in a year went to secondhand stores. I gave away the microwave because I can melt Velveeta on a stove.<br><br> And then came Marie Kondo&#x2019;s book <i>The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</i>. Or as I like to call it: &#x201c;Surprise, You&#x2019;re Still a Hoarder!&#x201d; <br><br> Kondo&#x2019;s big question is: Does it spark joy? <br><br> I took a harder look around my home and answered: Pretty boxes of novel manuscripts that were never pub�lished did not spark joy. Designer shoes I bought at sam�ple sales but never wore because they pinched my feet did not spark joy. My husband confessed that his inheritance of Greek doilies and paintings of fishing boats from his grandmother did not spark joy. So, out it all went. <br><br> And what is left is us. And my husband is happier. I&#x2019;m happier, too. Turns out I like a tidy house. And I like cleaning. <br><br> Dusting is meditative. Boiling the fridge relieves PMS. Making the bed is my cardio, because to make a bed properly, you have to circle it like a shark. And all the while, I listen to audiobooks I would be too embarrassed to be caught reading. Not in the mood to clean a toilet? Listen to <i>Naked Came the Stranger, </i>and see if that doesn&#x2019;t pass the time. <br><br> The downside is that my husband has created a mon�ster. I burn through paper towels like an arsonist. I joy�ride my vacuum&#x2014;which has a headlight&#x2014;in the dark.<br><br> And I don&#x2019;t do it in pearls and a crinoline skirt. It&#x2019;s not unusual for me to wear an apron over my pajamas.<br><br> I say, &#x201c;Hey, it&#x2019;s me or the apartment. We can&#x2019;t both be pristine.&#x201d;<br><br> Without hesitation, my husband will always choose the apartment.<br><br> Sometimes, I invite him to join in my efforts, offering him the most awful tasks as if I&#x2019;m giving him a treat. I&#x2019;ll say, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to <i>let you </i>scoop the cat box&#x201d; or &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to <i>let you </i>scrape the processed cheese out of the pan.&#x201d;<br><br> My husband says, &#x201c;You&#x2019;re like a dominatrix Donna Reed.&#x201d;<br><br> I say, &#x201c;Take off your shirt and scrape the pan, dear.&#x201d;<br><br> He takes off his shirt and scrapes the pan. In our more than twenty years together, my husband&#x2019;s nature hasn&#x2019;t changed.<br><br> Me, I&#x2019;m a recovering slob.

They paint the landscape with squash, corn, celery, beans, and a cornucopia of other fruits and vegetables. Their tools are the rake, the hoe, the pitchfork, the shovel, and the shears.

A candidate for the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1968, he was described by Milan Kundera as &#x201c;one of the great novelists of our century&#x201d; and by John Updike as &#x201c;one of the profoundest of the late moderns.&#x201d;<br>Gombrowicz&#x2019;s works were considered scandalous and subversive by the ruling powers in Poland and were banned for nearly forty years. He spent his last years in France teaching philosophy; this book is a series of reflections based on his lectures.<br>Gombrowicz discusses Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, Sartre, and Heidegger in six &#x201c;one-hour&#x201d; essays and addresses Marxism in a shorter &#x201c;fifteen-minute&#x201d; piece. The text&#x2014;a small literary gem full of sardonic wit, brilliant insights, and provocative criticism&#x2014;constructs the philosophical lineage of his work.</p></p><p><p><b>Witold Gombrowicz</b> is the author of <i>Ferdydurke, Trans-Atlantyk, Cosmos,</i> and<i> Pornografia</i>, the first three available from Yale University Press. These, along with his plays and the three-volume <i>Diary</i>, have been translated into more than thirty languages.</p>Though this slim volume is more a postmodern Cliffs Notes than a guide, readers who want to learn more about the big boys of Western thought have a fine tutor in Gombrowicz. Gliding effortlessly between straightforward exposition and far-reaching interpretation, with a healthy dose of respectful lampooning in between, Gombrowicz casts a lively, though dizzying, spell; on Schopenhauer's worldview: "It is a grandiose and tragic vision which, unfortunately, coincides perfectly with reality." Though his fluid prose sometimes obscures his meaning (considering Hegel's progress of reason, Gombrowicz's prose reads more like a performance: "Beyond time and space. There will no longer be any movement. Then poof! the ABSOLUTE."). Although the book covers no more than the standard group of Europeon Philosophy 101 figures (Kant, Hegel, Kierkegaard, Sartre, Heidegger, Marx, Nietzsche), it's far from introductory, playing fast and loose with some tricky concepts; readers entirely unfamiliar with the thinkers will find themselves lost at times, but the philosophy-conversant will find thought-provoking analysis and more than a few laughs. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The Irish troubles rage, but up at the &#39;Big House&#39;, tennis parties, dances and flirtations with the English officers continue, undisturbed by the ambushes, arrests and burning country beyond the gates. Faint vibrations of discord reach the young girl Lois, who is straining for her own freedom, and she will witness the troubles surge closer and reach their irrevocable, inevitable climax.</p><p>The Last September is Elizabeth Bowen's portrait of a young woman's coming of age in a brutalized time and place, where the ordinariness of life floats like music over the impending doom of history. <br>In 1920, at their country home in County Cork, Sir Richard Naylor and his wife, Lady Myra, and their friends maintain a skeptical attitude toward the events going on around them, but behind the facade of tennis parties and army camp dances, all know that the end is approaching--the end of British rule in the south of Ireland and the demise of a way of life that had survived for centuries. Their niece, Lois Farquar, attempts to live her own life and gain her own freedoms from the very class that her elders are vainly defending. The Last September depicts the tensions between love and the longing for freedom, between tradition and the terrifying prospect of independence, both political and spiritual. <br>"Brilliant....

The central character is Josip Lasta, the son of an impoverished school teacher in a remote village high in the mountains of the Bosnian interior. As the novel begins, World War II is underway and the entire region of Yugoslavia is torn by conflicting factions: German and Italian occupying armies, and the rebel forces that resist them?the fascist Ustashe, Serb nationalist Chetniks, and Communist Partisans. As events gather momentum, hell breaks loose, and the young and the innocent are caught in the path of great evils. Their only remaining strength is their religious faith and their families.</p><p></p><p></p><p>For more than a century, the confused and highly inflammatory history of former Yugoslavia has been the subject of numerous books, many of them rife with revisionist history and propaganda. The peoples of the Balkans live on the border of three worlds: the Islamic, the orthodox Slavic East, and Catholic Europe, and as such they stand in the path of major world conflicts that are not only geo-political but fundamentally spiritual. This novel cuts to the core question: how does a person retain his identity, indeed his humanity, in absolutely dehumanizing situations?</p><p></p><p></p><p>In the life of the central character, the author demonstrates that this will demand suffering and sacrifice, heroism and even holiness. When he is twelve years old, his entire world is destroyed, and so begins a lifelong Odyssey to find again the faith which the blows of evil have shattered. The plot takes the reader through Josip's youth, his young manhood, life under the Communist regime, hope and loss and unexpected blessings, the growth of his creative powers as a poet, and the ultimate test of his life. Ultimately this novel is about the crucifixion of a soul?and resurrection.</p><p></p></p><p><p><strong>Michael D.

As this study demonstrates, however, it is precisely these contradictions that make Ecclesiastes so meaningful and so powerfully relevant to life in the world. By looking carefully at the language and thought of Ecclesiastes, as well as at its uses of contradictions in probing the meaning of life, Fox confronts the problems that have confounded interpretation of this biblical book. He shows that by using contradiction to tear down holistic claims of meaning and purpose in the world and rebuilding meaning in a local, restricted sense instead, the author of Ecclesiastes shapes a bold, honest-and ultimately uplifting-vision of life. Based on solid scholarly insight yet readable by all, Fox&#39;s work provides some of the best commentary available on this challenging section of Scripture.</p><p>Michael V.

Friedman is a <em>New York Times</em> foreign affairs columnist, three-time Pulitzer Prize winner, and author of international best seller <em>Hot, Flat, and Crowded</em>.</strong></p> <p> Whatever you may be thinking when you apply for a job today, you can be sure your prospective employer is thinking this: Can this person add value every hour, every day--more than a worker in India, a robot, or a computer could? Can he or she help my company adapt by not only doing the job today but also reinventing the job for tomorrow? And can he or she adapt with all the change, so my company can adapt and export more into the fastest-growing global markets? In today's hyper-connected world, more and more companies cannot and will not hire people who don't fulfill those criteria. This is precisely why LinkedIn's founder, Reid Garrett Hoffman, one of the premier starter-uppers in Silicon Valley--besides cofounding LinkedIn, he is on the board of Zynga, was an early investor in Facebook, and sits on the board of Mozilla--has written <em>The Start-up of You</em>, coauthored with Ben Casnocha. Its subtitle could easily be: "Hey, recent graduates! Hey, thirty-five-year-old midcareer professional! Here's how you can build your career today." Here is our brief chat about their book.</p> <p> <strong>Tom</strong><strong>:</strong> You're a serial entrepreneur and venture capitalist. Why did you feel the need to offer this message?</p> <p> <strong>Reid</strong><strong>:</strong> As you write in <em>That Used to Be Us</em>, our country faces enormous challenges. The path to the American Dream has changed. We wanted to focus on what <em>individual</em> professionals can do to survive and thrive in a flat world. The premise of the book is that all of us are entrepreneurs of our own lives. We must act as CEO of our careers, take control of our professional future, and become globally competitive.</p> <p> <strong>Tom</strong><strong>:</strong> Really? Anyone can be an entrepreneur? Really? Even me?</p> <p> <strong>Reid</strong><strong>:</strong> Not only <em>can </em>anyone be an entrepreneur, but they <em>must</em> be. Even you, Tom! Not everyone should start companies, but everyone must be the entrepreneur of his or her own <em>life</em>. The skills people need to manage their careers are akin to the skills of entrepreneurs when they start and grow companies. For example, entrepreneurs can both be persistent on a plan and flexible when conditions change. They take intelligent risk. They build networks of allies and tap those networks for intelligence on what's happening in the world. Silicon Valley's most innovative entrepreneurs possess unique skills--you can learn them and apply them, no matter your profession.</p> <p> <strong>Tom</strong><strong>:</strong> Who is the target audience for this book?</p> <p> <strong>Reid</strong><strong>:</strong> Jeff Bezos says that at Amazon.com "it's always day one." This is a book for people just starting out, and it's equally for people midflight in their career who need to reinvent, restart, or reimagine their career as if it were day one, as if they were in permanent beta. We think that's most people, and eventually everyone.</p> <p> <strong>Tom</strong><strong>:</strong> What does it mean to be in "permanent beta?"</p> <p> <strong>Reid and Ben</strong><strong>:</strong> Technology companies sometimes keep the "beta" label on software for a time after the official launch to stress that the product is not finished, so much as ready for the next batch of improvements. For entrepreneurs, <em>finished</em> is an F-word. Great companies are always evolving. <em>Finished</em> ought to be an F-word for all of us. We are all works in progress. Each day presents an opportunity to learn more, do more, be more, grow more in our lives and careers. You will need to adapt and evolve forever--that's permanent beta.</p> <p> <strong>Tom</strong><strong>:</strong> Why the urgency of <em>The Start-up of You</em>?</p> <p> <strong>Reid and Ben</strong><strong>:</strong> A billboard that once ran along the 101 highway in Silicon Valley summed it up pithily: "A million people can do your job. What makes you so special?" We wanted to give people tools to take control of their lives, without having to wait around for the government or a company to rescue them.</p> <p> <strong>Tom</strong><strong>:</strong> Is China going to eat America's lunch?</p> <p> <strong>Reid and Ben</strong><strong>:</strong> National competitiveness is really a reflection of the individual competitiveness of its citizens. The question for each American is, "Is a professional in China going to eat <em>your </em>lunch?" Some will be competitive, and some will not. And the distinction is not set in stone. Just look at Detroit. All of us need to have a plan for investing in ourselves every day.</p>Reid Hoffman is co-founder and chairman of LinkedIn, the biggest professional social network in the world with more than 100 million members.

Are you in the habit of checking your doors and windows before you go to bed? Maybe even checking <i>under</i> your bed? If you are about to crack open Joe Hill's chilling thriller <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>, you might want to rethink your nighttime habits--Hill's story about an aging rock star (with a penchant for macabre artifacts) who buys a haunted suit online will scare you silly. But don't take our word for it. We asked bestselling authors (and masters of dark terror tales themselves) Scott Smith, and Harlan Coben to read <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> and give us their take. Check out their reviews below, and you might want to pick up a nightlight while you're at it. <i>--Daphne Durham</i><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Scott Smith</strong><br><br><b>In 1993, Scott Smith wowed readers with his stunning debut thriller, <i>A Simple Plan</i>. Thirteen years later, he spooked us again with <i>The Ruins</i>, a horror-thriller about four Americans traveling in Mexico who stumble across a nightmare in the jungle.</b> <br><br> The set-up for Joe Hill's novel, <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>, is appealingly simple. Jude Coyne, an aging rock star, buys himself a dead man's suit. He acquires it online, lured by the promise that the dead man's ghost will be included in his purchase. Jude thinks this is a joke, of course. He also assumes the seller is a stranger. We soon discover that he's wrong on both counts, however, and from this point on the story moves with an exhilarating urgency. Jude wants the ghost gone; the ghost wants Jude dead. We watch, chapter-by-chapter, as they battle for survival. "Watch" is the appropriate word, too, because this is an extremely visual book. Hill's prose is lean and precise, and he renders Jude's world with impressive confidence. It feels solid, every detail both correct and fresh. And this physicality provides a firm platform for the book's otherworldly happenings, which seem all the more frightening for being so securely grounded.<p> Hill has a flawless sense of pacing. His narrative never flags, nor does it ever move so quickly as to outrun itself. And one can sense his literary ambition pushing at the margins of the genre. There are times when his writing, for all its spare efficiency, seems to jump away from him, stopping one small step short of poetry. An e-mail to Jude from the ghost (trust me, it's not as absurd as it sounds) could even pass for something ee cummings might've written, in an especially morbid mood. And toward the end of the book, when Hill describes a trip down death's "night road" in a '65 Mustang, the passage has a startlingly lyrical beauty.</p><p> The story's horror ultimately has as much to do with Jude Coyne's past--his mistakes, abandonments and betrayals--as with anything supernatural. Jude has caused a lot of pain over the years, moving through life with a carelessness that verges on the callous. His battle with the ghost brings this behavior into sharp relief, forcing him to reflect upon his own capacity for cruelty. This dawning self-awareness leavens the book's bleakness and gore (and it is delightfully gory in places) with an unexpected sweetness. Despite our initial impression, Jude is gradually revealed--both to himself and the reader--as an essentially decent, even kind man. It's this kindness, this fledgling ability to love and be loved, that will ultimately be of crucial consequence in his death struggle with the ghost. And it's what makes Hill's debut not only well-written and terrifying, but also--as it draws to its close--surprisingly moving. So go ahead, take a chance, and open his <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>. I think you&#x2019;ll be happy you did. <i>--Scott Smith</i><br> </p></td> <td> <strong>Guest Reviewer: Harlan Coben</strong><br><br><b>Harlan Coben is the author of the beloved Myron Bolitar series about a wisecracking sports agent, as well as stunning stand-alone novels like <i>The Innocent</i> and his breakout thriller <i>Tell No One</i>.

It seems a random buy, but Judas soon learns that it is anything but. This particular ghost is one Craddock McDermott, step-father to recent suicide victim and boy, is he cranky. He demands revenge for his step-daughter&#x2019;s death, which he blames on Judas&#x2019;s shabby treatment of her.</p><p> Or is he after something else?</p><p> There are Amazon readers who will give you a better plot summary. Don't read them too closely because Joe Hill provides plenty of fun surprises. <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> is a true spine-tingler. I don&#x2019;t use that hyphenated word much anymore. We have seen and read it all, haven't we? But right away, in the first chapter, there was a subtle line that made the hairs on the back of my neck go up in a way I haven't experienced since I first discovered great horror as a teenager.</p><p> Hill writes with a sure hand. The prose is compelling. Like most memorable tales of horror, this book is more about redemption than scary moments--though <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i> has plenty of scares. They are visceral, shocking and very well done. The characters are flawed and real. The father-son relationship adds texture and surprising poignancy.</p><p> So here's the thing. My guess is, you won&#x2019;t find a ghost to buy online, but if you read the <i>Heart-Shaped Box</i>, you will be getting something that will haunt you and startle you and stay with you and yes, visit you in your dreams.</p><p> Sleep well, dear reader. <i>--Harlan Coben<br> </i></p></td> </tr> </tbody></table> <p></p><p>Judas Coyne is a collector of the macabre: a cookbook for cannibals . . . a used hangman's noose . . . a snuff film.

It is a tiny house, a coast guard&#x2019;s cottage, built more than three hundred years ago for people much smaller than her. The ceilings slope and bulge and her fourteen-year-old son needs to bow his head to get through the front door. They were all so little when she moved them here from London six years ago. Jasmine was ten. Kai was eight. And Romaine, the baby, was just four months old. She hadn&#x2019;t imagined that one day she&#x2019;d have a gangling child of almost six foot. She hadn&#x2019;t imagined that they&#x2019;d ever outgrow this place.<br> <br>Alice sits in her tiny room at the top of her tiny house. From here she runs her business. She makes art from old maps which she sells on the Internet for silly money. Silly money for a piece of art made from old maps, perhaps, but not silly money for a single mother of three. She sells a couple a week. It&#x2019;s enough, just about.<br> <br>Beyond her window, between Victorian streetlights, a string of sun-faded bunting swings back and forth in the boisterous April wind. To the left there is a slipway where small fishing boats form a colorful spine down to a concrete jetty and where the great, dreadful froth of the North Sea hits the rocky shoreline. And beyond that the sea. Black and infinite. Alice still feels awed by the sea, by its vast proximity. In Brixton, where she lived before, she had a view of walls, of other people&#x2019;s gardens, of distant towers and fumy skies. And suddenly, overnight, there was all this sea. When she sits on the sofa on the other side of the room it is all she can see, as though it is a part of the room, as though it is about to seep through the window frames and drown them all.<br> <br>She brings her gaze back to the screen of her iPad. On it she can see a small square room, a cat sitting on a green sofa licking its haunches, a pot of tea on the coffee table. She can hear voices from elsewhere, her mother talking to the carer. Her father talking to her mother. She can&#x2019;t quite hear what they&#x2019;re saying because the microphone on the webcam she set up in their living room last time she visited doesn&#x2019;t pick up sound properly in other rooms. But Alice is reassured that the carer is there, that her parents will be fed and medicated, washed and dressed, and that for an hour or two she won&#x2019;t need to worry about them.<br> <br>That&#x2019;s another thing she hadn&#x2019;t imagined when she&#x2019;d moved north six years ago. That her spry, clever, just-turned-seventy-year-old parents would both develop Alzheimer&#x2019;s within weeks of each other and require constant supervision and care.<br> <br>On the screen on Alice&#x2019;s laptop is an order form from a man called Max Fitzgibbon. He wants a rose made out of maps of Cumbria, Chelsea, and Saint-Tropez for his wife&#x2019;s fiftieth birthday. Alice can picture the man: well-preserved, silver-haired, in a heather-colored Joules zip-neck sweater, still hopelessly in love with his wife after twenty-five years of marriage. She can tell all this from his name, his address, from his choice of gift (&#x201c;big blowsy English roses have always been her favorite flower,&#x201d; he says in the &#x201c;any other comments&#x201d; box).<br> <br>Alice looks up from her screen and down through her window. He is still there. The man on the beach.<br> <br>He&#x2019;s been there all day, since she opened her curtains at seven o&#x2019;clock this morning, sitting on the damp sand, his arms around his knees, staring and staring out to sea. She&#x2019;s kept an eye on him, concerned that he might be about to top himself. That had happened once before. A young man, deathly pale in the blue-white moonlight, had left his coat on the beach and just disappeared. Alice is still haunted by the thought of him, three years later.<br> <br>But this man doesn&#x2019;t move. He just sits and stares. The air today is cold and blowing in hard, bringing with it a veil of icy droplets from the surface of the sea. But the man is wearing only a shirt and jeans. No jacket. No bag. No hat or scarf. There&#x2019;s something worrying about him; not quite scruffy enough to be a drifter, not quite strange enough to be a mental health patient from the day care center in town. He looks too healthy to be a junkie and he hasn&#x2019;t touched a drop of alcohol. He just looks . . . Alice searches her mind for the right word and then it comes to her. He looks lost.<br> <br><br> <br>An hour later the rain comes down. Alice peers through the spattered windowpanes and down to the beach below. He&#x2019;s still there. His brown hair is stuck to his skull and his shoulders and sleeves are dark with water. In half an hour she needs to collect Romaine from school. She makes a split-second decision.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hero!&#x201d; she calls to the brindle Staffy.<br> <br>&#x201c;Sadie!&#x201d; she calls to the ancient poodle.<br> <br>&#x201c;Griff!&#x201d; she calls to the greyhound. &#x201c;Walkies!&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice has three dogs. Griff, the greyhound, is the only one she deliberately went out and chose. The poodle is her parents&#x2019;. She is eighteen years old and should be dead by rights. Half her fur is gone and her legs are bald and thin as birds&#x2019; but she still insists on joining the other dogs for a walk. And Hero, the Staffy, belonged to Barry, a man who&#x2019;d rented her shed from her a while back. He disappeared one day and left everything behind, including his mental dog. Hero has to wear a muzzle on the street; otherwise she attacks prams and scooters.<br> <br>Alice clips their leads to their collars as they circle her ankles and notices something else that Barry left behind in his midnight flit, hanging from the coat hooks next to the leads. A shabby old jacket. She automatically wrinkles her nose at the sight of it. She once slept with Barry in a moment of sheer stupidity&#x2014;and intense loneliness&#x2014;and regretted it from the moment he lay down on top of her and she realized that he smelled of cheese. That it emanated from every crevice of his slightly lardy body. She&#x2019;d held her breath and got on with it but ever after she associated him with that smell.<br> <br>She plucks the jacket gingerly from the peg and drapes it over her arm. Then she takes the dogs and an umbrella and heads toward the beach.<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Here,&#x201d; she says, passing the coat to the man. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a bit smelly but it&#x2019;s waterproof. And look, it has a hood.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man turns slowly and looks at her.<br> <br>He doesn&#x2019;t seem to have registered her intention, so she babbles.<br> <br>&#x201c;It belonged to Barry. Ex-lodger. He was about the same size as you. But you smell better. Well, not that I can tell from here. But you look like you smell nice.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man looks at Alice and then down at the jacket.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;do you want it?&#x201d;<br> <br>Still no response.<br> <br>&#x201c;Look. I&#x2019;m just going to leave it here with you. I don&#x2019;t need it and I don&#x2019;t want it and you may as well keep it. Even if you just use it to sit on. Shove it in a bin if you like.&#x201d;<br> <br>She drops it near his feet and straightens herself up. His eyes follow her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Ah, so you do talk?&#x201d;<br> <br>He looks surprised. &#x201c;Of course I talk.&#x201d;<br> <br>He has a southern accent. His eyes are the same shade of ginger brown as his hair and the stubble on his chin. He&#x2019;s handsome. If you like that kind of thing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Good,&#x201d; she says, putting her free hand into her pocket, the other grasping the handle of her umbrella. &#x201c;Glad to hear it.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiles and clutches the damp jacket in his fist. &#x201c;You sure?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;About that?&#x201d; She eyes the jacket. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d be doing me a favor. Seriously.&#x201d;<br> <br>He pulls the jacket on over his wet clothes and fiddles with the zip for a while before fastening it. &#x201c;Thank you,&#x201d; he says again. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice turns to check the locations of the dogs. Sadie sits thin and damp by her feet; the other two are scampering at the water&#x2019;s edge. Then she turns back to the man. &#x201c;Why don&#x2019;t you get indoors, out of this rain?&#x201d; she asks. &#x201c;Forecast says it&#x2019;s set to rain till tomorrow morning. You&#x2019;re going to make yourself ill.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he asks, his eyes narrowed, as though she&#x2019;d introduced herself already and he&#x2019;d momentarily forgotten her name.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m Alice. You don&#x2019;t know me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; He appears reassured by this.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; says Alice, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d better get on.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice takes up the slack in Sadie&#x2019;s lead and the poodle gets unsteadily to her feet, like a freshly birthed giraffe.<br> <br>She calls for the other two. They ignore her. She tuts and calls again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Bloody idiots,&#x201d; she mutters under her breath. &#x201c;Come on!&#x201d; she yells, striding toward them. &#x201c;Get here now!&#x201d;<br> <br>They are both in and out of the sea. Hero is covered in a layer of green-hued mulch. They will stink. And it is nearly time to collect Romaine. She can&#x2019;t be late again. She&#x2019;d been late yesterday because she&#x2019;d overrun on a piece of work, forgotten the time, and at 3:50 had to retrieve Romaine from the school office, where the secretary had looked at her over the top of the desk screen as though she were a stain on the carpet.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, you shitbags!&#x201d; She strides across the beach and makes a grab for Griff. Griff thinks a game has been suggested and darts playfully away. She goes after Hero, who runs away from her. Meanwhile poor Sadie is being dragged about by her scrawny neck, barely able to stand upright, and the rain is coming down and Alice&#x2019;s jeans are sodden and her hands icy cold and the time is ticking away. She lets out a yell of frustration and takes an approach she used with all the children when they were toddlers.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;fine. You stay here. See how you get on without me. Go and beg for scraps outside the fucking butcher&#x2019;s. Have a good life.&#x201d;<br> <br>The dogs stop and look at her. She turns and walks away.<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you want some dogs?&#x201d; she calls to the man, who is still sitting in the rain. &#x201c;Seriously? Do you want them? You can have them.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man startles and looks up at her with his gingerbread eyes. &#x201c;I . . . I . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>She rolls her eyes. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not being serious.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;No. I know that.&#x201d;<br> <br>She strides toward the slipway, toward the steps carved into the seawall. It&#x2019;s three thirty. The dogs stop at the shoreline, glance at each other, then back at Alice. Then they run for her, arriving at her feet seconds later, salty and pungent.<br> <br>Alice starts up the steps and then turns back when the man calls after her.<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me!&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Excuse me. Where am I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where am I? What&#x2019;s the name of this place?&#x201d;<br> <br>She laughs. &#x201c;Really?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Really.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is Ridinghouse Bay.&#x201d;<br> <br>He nods. &#x201c;Right,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Get inside, will you,&#x201d; she says softly to the man. &#x201c;Please get out of this rain.&#x201d;<br> <br>He smiles apologetically and Alice waves and heads toward the school, hoping he&#x2019;ll be gone by the time she gets back.<br> <br><br> <br>Alice knows she&#x2019;s something of an oddball in Ridinghouse Bay. Which, in fairness, was already pretty full of oddballs before she arrived. But even in a town this strange Alice stands out with her Brixton accent and her Benetton family and her slightly brusque ways. Not to mention the dogs. They make a show of her everywhere she goes. They will not walk to heel, they bark and snap, they whine outside shops. She&#x2019;s seen people cross the street to avoid her animals, Hero in particular with her muzzle and her huge muscular shoulders.<br> <br>Ever since she got here Alice has played the role of the enigmatic, slightly scary loner, though that is not at all what she is. In London she had friends coming out of her ears. More friends than she knew what to do with. She was a party girl, a come-over-later-with-a-bottle-of-vodka-we&#x2019;ll-put-the-world-to-rights girl. She&#x2019;d been the kind of mum to stand at the school gates after drop-off and say, come on then, who&#x2019;s up for a coffee? And she&#x2019;d be there at the heart of them all, laughing the loudest, talking the most. Until she pushed it too far and blew her life open.<br> <br>But she has a friend here now. Someone who gets her. Derry Dynes. They met eighteen months ago, on Romaine&#x2019;s first day in school. Their eyes met and there was a flash of mutual recognition, of shared delight. &#x201c;Fancy a coffee?&#x201d; Derry Dynes had said, seeing the film of tears over Alice&#x2019;s eyes as she watched her baby girl disappear into the classroom. &#x201c;Or something stronger?&#x201d;<br> <br>Derry is about five years older than Alice and about a foot shorter. She has a son the same age as Romaine and a grown-up daughter who lives in Edinburgh. She loves dogs (she&#x2019;s the type to let them kiss her on her mouth) and she loves Alice. Early on she learned that Alice was prone to making terrible decisions and letting life run away with her and now she acts as Alice&#x2019;s moderator. She sits and counsels Alice for hours about issues she has with the school over their handling of Romaine&#x2019;s learning difficulties but stops her from storming into the office to shout at the secretary. She&#x2019;ll share two bottles of wine with her on a school night but encourage her to stick the cork back into the third. She tells her which hairdresser to go to and what to ask for&#x2014;&#x201c;ask for stepped layers, not feathered, and a half head of highlights with foils.&#x201d; She used to be a hairdresser but now she&#x2019;s a Reiki therapist. And she has more of an idea about Alice&#x2019;s finances than Alice herself.<br> <br>She&#x2019;s standing outside the school now, under a huge red umbrella, her boy Danny and Romaine nestled together underneath.<br> <br>&#x201c;Christ. Thank you. Dogs went mental on the beach and I couldn&#x2019;t get them back.&#x201d;<br> <br>She leans down to kiss the crown of Romaine&#x2019;s head and takes her lunch box from her.<br> <br>&#x201c;What on earth were you doing on the beach in this weather?&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice tuts and says, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t want to know.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; says Derry. &#x201c;I do.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you busy? Got time for a cup of tea?&#x201d;<br> <br>Derry looks down at her son and says, &#x201c;Well, I was supposed to be taking this one into town for shoes . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, just come via mine then, I&#x2019;ll show you.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; she says, standing by the seawall, peering down through the cascade of rain pouring off her umbrella.<br> <br>He is still there.<br> <br>&#x201c;Him?&#x201d; says Derry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. Him. I gave him that jacket. One of Barry&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>Derry gives an involuntary shudder. She remembers Barry too. Alice gave her a very thorough and evocative description of events at the time.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did he not have a coat then? Before?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Sitting there in a shirt. Soaked. Asked me where he was.&#x201d;<br> <br>The two children pull themselves up onto the edge of the wall by their fingertips and peer over.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where he was?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes. He seemed a bit confused.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t get involved,&#x201d; says Derry.<br> <br>&#x201c;Who said I was getting involved?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You gave him a jacket. You&#x2019;re already getting involved.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That was just an act of simple human kindness.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; says Derry. &#x201c;Exactly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Alice tuts at her friend and heads away from the seawall. &#x201c;Are you seriously going shopping?&#x201d; she asks her. &#x201c;In this?&#x201d;<br> <br>Derry peers into the dark skies overhead and says, &#x201c;No. Maybe not.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on then,&#x201d; says Alice. &#x201c;Come to mine. I&#x2019;ll put a fire on.&#x201d;<br> <br><br> <br>Derry and Danny stay for a couple of hours.

His books include studies of Donne, Dickens and Thackeray, <i>The Intellectuals and the Masses</i>, <i>What Good Are the</i> <i>Arts?</i> and a life of William Golding., John Carey is an Emeritus Professor at Oxford University and a Fellow of the British Academy. His books include studies of Donne, Dickens and Thackeray, <i>The Intellectuals and the Masses</i>, <i>What Good Are the</i> <i>Arts?</i> and a life of William Golding.The obscurities of modern art and literature, according to Carey (English/Oxford; John Donne, 1981), were devised by the intelligentsia to exclude the new reading public for whom they had contempt--a thesis that Carey applies here to, among others, George Gissing, H.G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, and Wyndham Lewis. Nietzsche, Yeats, Shaw, Flaubert, Ibsen, Ortega y Gasset, E.M. Forster, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce--indeed the entire modernist movement, says Carey, depicted the ``masses'' and the popular culture they generated with disdain. These writers, the author contends, worshiped the lofty, isolated, high-minded artist who produced an alienating art without human or narrative content to which the masses could relate. Followers of Freud, the intelligentsia feared crowds and condemned their suburban refuges as culturally impoverished ecological disasters. Gissing concluded that the masses were ineducable, while Wells considered them manifestations of a ``biological catastrophe.'' Meanwhile, Bennett, the ``hero'' of Carey's study, believed that the people could be redeemed through the study of literature, although Wyndham Lewis- -whom Carey compares to Hitler--felt that the democracy they believed in was effeminate. The author attempts to demonstrate how Mein Kampf was firmly rooted in the intelligentsia's orthodoxy--and how the incineration of Jews was an extension of it. Members of The intelligentsia, he says, believed that they formed a natural aristocracy united by an esoteric body of knowledge that protected them from the herd. Concluding with a chilling analogy, Carey suggests that the influence and style of the turn-of-the-century intelligentsia survives in the obfuscations of contemporary criticism. Provocative, courageous, certainly stimulating--and reflecting a profound understanding of the often invisible yet potentially insidious relationship between aesthetics and politics, as well as of how art can be used to camouflage the most repugnant ideas. -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

The introduction discusses Apollonios in his Alexandrian world and proposes a new understanding of his poetic puropse and acheivement. The commentary is especially good at explaining mythical allusions which abound.</p><p>"Peter Green turns his formidable classical learning and his finely nuanced sense of English verse to bear on the challenge of restoring Apollonios to his true place&#x2014;on a par with the best modern poetic versions of Homer and Virgil."&#x2014;Robert Fagles, translator of Homer's <i>Iliad</i><br><br>"The style is crisp, energetic, and masculine in the narrative, but not unsympathetic to the love-suffering of Medeia."&#x2014;Jasper Griffin, Oxford University<br><br>"A smooth-running and highly readable verse translation of Apollonios's epic tale of the voyage of the Argonauts from the pen of a writer whose elegant verse translations of Ovid's <i>Erotic Poems</i> and Juvenal's <i>Satires</i> have long been justly admired by scholars and the general public alike.

Furtw ngler&#39;s recordings remain for many the standard by which all subsequent performances are judged. This study offers an overview of his career and his place in the mainstream of the German school of conducting, with commentaries on all his recorded performances.</p><p>Widely regarded during his lifetime as <i>the</i> custodian of the German musical tradition, Wilhelm Furtw&#x201e;ngler (1886-1954) is one of the greatest conductors of this century and one of the most controversial. His inward-looking, spiritually intense interpretations exert their spell through recordings to this day, yet his reputation has suffered from the stigma of his decision not to leave Nazi Germany and to continue his direction of the Berlin Philharmonic. Ardoin provides a useful overview of Furtw&#x201e;ngler's career, but the backbone of his book is a study of the conductor's recorded legacy. Ardoin groups the recordings by musical period (baroque, classical, etc.), provides exhaustive information about Furtw&#x201e;ngler's various recordings of each particular score, and uses excerpts from Furtw&#x201e;ngler's diaries and correspondence to illuminate his interpretative approach to individual composers and scores especially well. Furtw&#x201e;ngler's interpretations remain a basic gloss on the works of the German musical masters, and because they remain accessible in recordings, Ardoin's exhaustive study will be valuable in any library with patrons deeply interested in classical music. <i>John Shreffler</i>Books continue to proliferate about the great German conductor, who died 40 years ago. This one by Dallas-based music critic Ardoin is perhaps the most useful of them, a deeply informed guide to the maestro's significant recordings together with Furtwangler's own thoughts on interpretation of many of the works Ardoin discusses. Ardoin is an unabashed admirer, who finds that "what was a circumscribed cult [of enthusiasts] in the first decade following his death has become a widespread phenomenon." He champions Furtwangler against Arturo Toscanini as the century's greatest conductor, joins those who find the maestro naive but not blameworthy in electing to stay in Nazi Germany, and feels that we will not look upon his like again. There is a wonderfully thorough discography (by John Hunt), which emphasizes the remarkable fact that almost every major recording Furtwangler made is now available on CD. An invaluable book for admirers and record collectors.

The story kicks off when Father Dowling's offered a pair of coveted USCNotre Dame tickets designed to lure him to a South Bend, Ind., conference whose special guest will be iron-willed conservative Cardinal Josef Hildebrand. Before he can get to the 45-yard line, though, Father Dowling, recently escaped from the local marriage tribunal that grants annulments, will have to listen to Michael Geary and Maureen Furey accuse each other of ruining their marriage, then get updates every hour after Geary--who's already weathered an organist's accusation of unwanted sexual advances--is found dead (strangled? poisoned?) in the back of his car. Surviving him are, among others, his son Brian, a self- tormented hermit who insists he killed his father, and his brother- in-law, Gordon Furey, the police suspect, who exonerates himself by getting killed in the back of his car. Also on hand are Catherine Burger, Geary's sweetie; her son Freddy, president of Victims of Canon Law; somebody who has an unaccountable attachment to plastic dashboard madonnas; and the world's most inept kidnapper. McInerny's attempt to move in on Andrew Greeley territory- -surely a crossroads in his distinguished career--doesn't quite come off: His convincingly troubled supporting cast keeps running away with--or from--the routine whodunit, as if they'd just as soon be rid of Father Dowling and all his works. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Spence uses the case not only to address the issue of race, but also to attack the media orgy and the culture of celebrity obsession and materialistic greed.</p><p>Buried under windbag sermonizing and lofty moralizing lies a cogent analysis of how the prosecution lost the O.J. Simpson case. Celebrated defense attorney Spence (The Making of a Country Lawyer, 1996, etc.) devotes the first half of his book to establishing his bona fides as a man of the people: a country bumpkin in a buckskin jacket, a lawyer who scorns lawyers (who he witheringly says lack ``personhood'') and idealizes jurors (simple folks drenched in the wisdom of life experience). Spence can also be wildly inconsistent, at one moment saying, for instance, that Faye Resnick's account has a ring of truth, at another labeling it ``swill.'' But despite arrogant lawyers and dishonest cops, the real villain for Spence is the media and its ``rape of the judicial process''--invading the courtroom, corrupting the lawyers by making them celebrities, and offering endless punditry by commentators who, Spence claims, know nothing about trying a case. Of course, he admits, he was a media pundit himself. Still, he is a leading trial attorney (whom Simpson had wanted on his defense team), and he scores some illuminating points on why Marcia Clark and Chris Darden failed to make their case to the jury--and outlines the case they could have made. Most chilling is his retelling of two incidents: First, the events of January 1, 1989, when police responded to a battered Nicole Simpson's call for help--O.J.'s escape that night paralleled his escape after Nicole's and Ron Goldman's murder. Even more eerie is another incident never presented at the criminal trial: Right before the murders, Simpson was filming a scene for a TV show that also strangely prefigured the murders and in which, playing a former SEAL, he could have learned the slashing technique used to kill his ex-wife and her friend. Spence believes that O.J. was guilty but that the jury's acquittal was just. If his brief were less self-righteous, his legitimate arguments would be easier to swallow. (Literary Guild selection) -- <i>Copyright �1997, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>One of the nation's most prominent trial lawyers, Spence (The Making of a Country Lawyer, LJ 10/15/96) has never lost a criminal case. He presents here a compelling postmortem of the O.J. Simpson criminal trial and exposes the shortcomings of all the parties involved, especially the prosecution. Spence is particularly critical of lead prosecutor Marcia Clark, who, he feels, was the wrong messenger presenting the wrong case to the wrong audience. He points out the prosecution's failures, from jury selection through closing arguments, especially noting the inability of Clark and coprosecutor Chris Darden to keep their emotions under control, their insistence on using a sterile approach in presenting expert testimony, and their reluctance to present critical evidence in a matter-of-fact, folksy manner that the jury could have appreciated. The race issue is also discussed, especially in terms of how the prosecution could have more successfully presented the case to a jury for whom the sociology of race was of paramount, though not ostensible, importance.

Indeed, some of the greatest dramas of World War II were played out in the skies, from the heart-stopping maneuvers of warbird pilots engaged in aerial combat against closely matched enemy aircraft to the daring bombing missions that saw pilots face the toughest aerial defenses ever designed. Costs in men and machinery were high, but all involved were united by a sense of camaraderie and in the end, these steel-nerved crews changed the course of the war. Aviation Art of World War II presents more than two hundred dramatic paintings that capture these aerial encounters in vivid detail, featuring contributions from today&#39;s most noted aviation artists, including Robert Bailey, Stan Stokes, Robert Taylor, Jim Dietz, Keith Ferris, and Roy Grinnell. Each scene has been painstakingly researched to create the most historically accurate depiction possible, giving readers an eyewitness snapshot of the action. Extensive captions describe the scene taking place and offer details on the planes, pilots, and crews, while archival photographs of the individuals involved breathe life into each meticulously rendered painting.

Inspired by the books of Maurice Sendak, Brown decided to pursue his ambition of becoming an illustrator. After receiving a B.F.A. in painting from the Cleveland Institute of Art, he worked as a TV art director, a professor of mechanical drawing, and a freelance illustrator, before becoming a writer. In his books, he addresses the fears and problems which children face and events like friendship, family, school and pets. For his illustrations, Brown uses pencil with watercolor on a variety of papers to achieve different visual effects. The &#34;Arthur&#34; series, about the everyday adventures of a lovable aardvark, began in 1976 and continues to this day with 25 titles published. Brown has also created other series such as the &#34;Rhymes&#34; series, and the nonfiction &#34;Dinosaur&#34; series, which conveys messages of do&#39;s and don&#39;ts. These series, like the stories of Arthur, hold the attention of young children while transporting their imaginations on magical journeys.PreSchool-Grade 2. Sure to be popular due to the success of the new PBS television series, these new additions to the series demonstrate the vocal talent of author/illustrator Marc Brown. Arthur's creator reads the texts, giving each character a distinctive voice. He is able to portray the females, like mother and D.W., while avoiding stereotypical high, squeaky voices. The production values on the recordings are excellent, with background music and helpful sound effects. The slamming of car doors, the sound of rain or footsteps, and other sound effects give the tapes the quality of old radio shows. Each tape opens with the theme song, "Say Hello to Arthur." Both sides of each tape are the same except for the page-turning signal bell on one side. In Arthur's Family Vacation, rain ruins the family's stay at the beach until Arthur thinks of activities they can do. In Arthur's Halloween, Arthur and D.W. learn you can't presume a house is haunted just because the outside looks run down. The artwork in each book features Brown's customary cartoon-like ink and watercolor illustrations that add humor to the stories. The tapes work well even without the books.<br><i>Penny Peck, San Leandro Public Library, CA</i><br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Shadow Speaker</h2><p>&nbsp;Driven by vengeance.

In testament to the first stands the full body of his life&#x2019;s work, including some 12,000 writings and 3,000 tape-recorded lectures of Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; &nbsp;In evidence of the second are the hundreds of millions of individuals whose lives have been demonstrably bettered because he lived. They are the more than 28 million students now reading superlatively owing to L. Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s educational discoveries; they are the millions of men and women freed from substance abuse through L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s breakthroughs in drug rehabilitation; they are the near 100 million who have been touched by his nonreligious moral code: and they are the many millions more who hold his work to be the spiritual cornerstone of their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>Although best known for Dianetics and Scientology, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard cannot be so simply categorized. If nothing else, his life was too varied, his influence too broad. There are tribesmen in Southern Africa, for example, who know nothing of Dianetics and Scientology, but they know L. Ron Hubbard the educator.&nbsp; Likewise, there are factory workers in Albania who know him only for his administrative discoveries; children in China who know him only as the author of their moral code, and readers in dozens of languages who know him only for his novels. So, no, L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is not an easy man to categorize and certainly does not fit popular misconceptions of &#x201c;religious founder&#x201d; as an aloof and contemplative figure. Yet the more one comes to know this man and his achievements, the more one comes to realize he was precisely the sort of person to have brought us Scientology, the only major religion to have been founded in the twentieth century.&nbsp;</p><p>What Scientology offers is likewise what one would expect of a man such as&nbsp; L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard. For not only does it provide a fully unique approach to our most fundamental questions&#x2014;Who are we? From where did we come and what is our destiny? But it further provides an equally unique technology for greater spiritual awareness. So how would we expect to characterize the founder of such a religion? Clearly, he would have to be larger than life, attracted to people, liked by people, dynamic, charismatic and immensely capable in a dozen fields&#x2014;all exactly L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard.&nbsp;</p><p>The fact is, if Mr. Hubbard had stopped after only one of his many accomplishments he would still be celebrated today. For example, with 46 million works of fiction in circulation, including such monumental bestsellers as Battlefield Earth, Fear and the Mission Earth series, Mr. Hubbard is unquestionably one of the most acclaimed and widely read authors of all time. His novels have earned some of the world&#x2019;s most prestigious literary awards, and he has very genuinely been described as &#x201c;one of the most prolific and influential writers of the twentieth century.&#x201d;&nbsp;</p><p>His earlier accomplishments are similarly impressive. As a barnstorming aviator through the 1930s he was known as &#x201c;Flash&#x201d; and broke local records for sustained glider flight. As a leader of expeditions, he is credited with conducting the first complete Puerto Rican mineralogical survey under United States protectorship and his navigational annotations still influence the maritime guides for British Columbia. His experimentation with early radio direction finding further became the basis for the Long Range Navigational system (Loran). And, as a lifelong photographer, his works have been displayed in galleries on two continents, with the definitive body of his photographs in traveling and permanent exhibits still drawing tens of thousands every year.&nbsp;</p><p>Among other avenues of research, Mr. Hubbard developed and codified an administrative technology that is utilized by more than 200,000 organizations worldwide, including multinational corporations, charitable bodies, political parties, schools, youth clubs and every imaginable small business. Likewise Mr. Hubbard&#x2019;s internationally acclaimed educational methods are utilized by more than a hundred thousand educators, while his equally acclaimed drug rehabilitation program has proven at least five times more effective than similarly aimed programs.&nbsp;</p> <p>Yet, however impressive these figures, no measure of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard is complete without some appreciation of what became his life&#x2019;s work: Dianetics and Scientology.&nbsp; The world&#x2019;s most effective force for positive change, the Church of Scientology represents spiritual freedom for millions of people the world over. They come from every walk of life, every culture and every strata of society. Moreover, when one is speaking of L.&nbsp;Ron Hubbard&#x2019;s discoveries relating to the human mind and spirit, one is ultimately speaking of the philosophic foundation of all he accomplished: better education, crime-free cities, drug-free campuses, stable and ethical organizations and cultural revitalization through the arts&#x2014;all this and more is made possible because of the breakthroughs in Dianetics and Scientology.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>William Pitt the Younger</h2><p>William Pitt the Younger is an illuminating biography of one of the great iconic figures in British history: the man who in 1784 at the age of twenty-four became (and so remains) the youngest Prime Minister in the history of England. In this lively and authoritative study, William Hague&#x2013;himself the youngest political party leader in recent history&#x2013;explains the dramatic events and exceptional abilities that allowed extreme youth to be combined with great power. <br>The brilliant son of a father who was also Prime Minister, Pitt was derided as a &#x201c;schoolboy&#x201d; when he took office. Yet within months he had outwitted his opponents, and he went on to dominate the political scene for twenty-two years (nineteen of them as Prime Minister). No British politician since has exercised such supremacy for so long.<br><br>Pitt&#x2019;s personality has always been hard to unravel. Though he was generally thought to be cold and aloof, his friends described him as the wittiest man they ever knew. By seeing him through the eyes of a politician, William Hague&#x2013;a prominent member of Britain&#x2019;s Conservative Party&#x2013;succeeds in explaining Pitt&#x2019;s actions and motives through a series of great national crises, including the madness of King George III, the impact of the French Revolution, and the trauma of the Napoleonic wars. He describes how a man dedicated to peace became Britain&#x2019;s longest-serving war leader, how Pitt the liberal reformer became Pitt the author of repression, and how&#x2013;though undisputed master of the nation&#x2019;s finances&#x2013;he died with vast personal debts. <br><br>With its rich cast of characters, including Charles James Fox, Richard Brinsley Sheridan, Edmund Burke, and George III himself, and set against a backdrop of industrial revolution and global conflict, this is a richly detailed and rounded portrait of an extraordinary political life.</p><p>William Hague has served in various capacities in the British government since 1989. He became the leader of the Conservative Party in 1997 and in the same year led the party&#x2019;s campaign for Parliament. He lives in Yorkshire, England.Chapter One<br>Elder and Younger<br><br>It would scarcely be possible to imagine a more intensely political family than the one into which William Pitt was born on 28 May 1759. On his father's side, his great-grandfather, grandfather and uncle had all been members of Parliament. His father, twenty-five years an MP, was now the leading Minister of the land. On his mother's side, that of the Grenville family, one uncle was in the House of Lords, and two others were in the Commons, one of them to be First Lord of the Treasury by the time the infant William was four years old. An understanding of Pitt's extraordinary political precocity requires us to appreciate the unusual circumstances of a family so wholeheartedly committed to political life.<br><br>It was in the year of William's birth that the career of his father, still also plain William Pitt, approached its zenith. Three years into what would later be known as the Seven Years' War, in which Britain stood as the only substantial ally of Prussia against the combined forces of France, Austria, Russia, Saxony and Sweden, the elder Pitt had become the effective Commander-in-Chief under King George II of the British prosecution of the war. In his view the war had arisen from "a total subversion of the system of Europe, and more especially from the most pernicious extension of the influence of France." He was not nominally the head of the government, the position of First Lord of the Treasury being held by his old rival the Duke of Newcastle, but he was the senior Minister in the House of Commons. Through his powerful oratory he dominated both Parliament and the Ministry, and was acknowledged as the effective leader of the administration. As Newcastle himself said in October of that year: "No one will have a majority at present against Mr. Pitt. No man will, in the present conjuncture, set his face against Mr. Pitt in the H. of Commons."<br><br> From taking office at the age of forty-eight in 1756 as Secretary of State for the Southern Department,* with a brief interruption of two months during the cabinet crisis of 1757, Pitt had become the principal source of ministerial energy in both organising for war and in preparing a strategy for Britain to do well out of it. It was Pitt who gave detailed instructions on the raising and disposition of the troops and the navy, and Pitt who insisted on and executed the objective of destroying the empire of France. As the French envoy, Fran�ois de Bussy, was to complain to the leading French Minister, the Duc de Choiseul, after meeting Pitt in 1761: "This Minister is, as you know, the idol of the people, who regard him as the sole author of their success . . . He is very eloquent, specious, wheedling, and with all the chicanery of an experienced lawyer. He is courageous to the point of rashness, he supports his ideas in an impassioned fashion and with an invincible determination, seeking to subjugate all the world by the tyranny of his opinions, Pitt seems to have no other ambition than to elevate Britain to the highest point of glory and to abase France to the lowest degree of humiliation . . ."<br><br>It was in 1759 that Pitt, previously dismissed as a rather unpredictable politician with a distinctly chequered career, came to be regarded as the saviour of the nation. His insistence on fighting a European war with offensives elsewhere-in America, the Caribbean, Africa and on the oceans of the world-was crowned with success within months of the birth of his second son, William. Instead of having to face the French invasion feared throughout much of the year, Britain celebrated a stream of military successes that summer and autumn: victory at Minden in Germany in August, the storming of Quebec which shattered French rule in Canada in September, the simultaneous news of victories which reinforced British dominance of India, and then the defeat and scattering of the French fleet at Quiberon Bay in November. These events brought about a change in the public perception of the elder Pitt, analogous to the regard in which Churchill was held after 1940 compared to the controversy which previously surrounded him. From then on there was a sense of reverence, sometimes of awe, towards him, both on parliamentary occasions and among the wider public. Tall, haughty, but always eloquent, he was the great orator and war leader who had placed himself beyond party gatherings and factions to be at the service of the nation. The young William, as he became conscious of the people and events around him, would know only a world in which his father was treated as a legend.<br><br>Such renown was a far cry from the frustrated ambitions of earlier generations of Pitts. Being a younger son, the elder Pitt had enjoyed little in the way of financial inheritance, but his ancestors and relatives had been well connected and often very wealthy for the previous century and a half. Pitt's forebears had included prominent and sometimes wealthy officials under Elizabeth I and James I, but it is Thomas Pitt of Bocconoc (1653-1726) who brings the family story to life. He was the buccaneering "Diamond Pitt" who went to India and made a fortune in probably illegal competition with the East India Company, came back and purchased English property with it, including the medieval borough of Old Sarum,* and then returned to India on behalf of the Company as Governor of Madras. While there, he bought a 130-carat diamond for �25,000 which he hoped to sell to one of the European royal families for at least ten times as much. Returning to Britain during the War of the Spanish Succession (1702-1713), he discovered that European royalty was otherwise preoccupied, but eventually sold the diamond at a substantial but much smaller than expected profit to the Regent of France. With this and other earnings from his exploits in India, Thomas Pitt set about buying more estates, particularly in Cornwall. He was part of a new and often resented breed of rich men who came back from the East to buy property and parliamentary influence at home. He used his wealth to help all five of his children on their way in life, particularly the eldest son, another Thomas Pitt, who kept most of the family wealth and became Earl of Londonderry. A younger son, Robert Pitt, was put into Parliament for Old Sarum in 1705, for which he sometimes sat alongside his father. Robert Pitt was undistinguished, came close to disaster by being on the fringes of Jacobite attempts to overthrow the new Hanoverian dynasty, and died young, but not before fathering six children, the fifth of whom was William Pitt, the future Earl of Chatham. Once again the eldest son was a Thomas Pitt, who after much litigation and family dispute ended up with the lion's share of the family wealth.<br><br>The family lived at Stratford-sub-Castle near Salisbury, but at the age of ten William was sent with his eldest brother, Thomas, to Eton, an experience which proved decisive in his later determination to educate all of his own children at home. He remarked much later to the Earl of Shelburne that he "scarce observed a boy who was not cowed for life at Eton; that a publick school might suit a boy of a turbulent forward disposition, but would not do where there was any gentleness."<br><br>It seems that Robert Pitt had intended William for the Church, but William himself had other ideas, joining the army at the lowest officer rank in the cavalry, as a Cornet of Dragoons. He never saw active service, since the long-serving Whig Minister Robert Walpole did an effective job of keeping Britain out of various international disputes at the time, but he took the opportunity to travel to the Continent on a modest version of the Grand Tour through France, Switzerland and Holland. This was the only time he left his native country; an eighteenth-century political career did not require extensive travel. Like his son, he was later to dispose of huge forces, alliances and treaties around the globe, while only once in his life leaving the shores of Britain. He was clearly determined to continue the emerging Pitt tradition of serving in Parliament, and was duly elected for the family borough of Old Sarum in the general election of 1734, but only after some acrimony when his brother Thomas suggested giving the seat to the sitting member, with financial compensation for William instead.<br><br>Although Pitt seems to have been well disposed towards Walpole and the Whigs at the time he was elected, he soon fell in with key figures in the opposition, notably Lord Cobham, his ex-Colonel, and Prince Frederick, the Prince of Wales. The relationship between Prince Frederick and his father, King George II, was an early example of a noted Hanoverian tradition, being one of unmitigated hatred between monarch and heir. The Prince of Wales was truly loathed by both his father and mother. Queen Caroline once exclaimed when she saw the Prince pass her dressing-room window: "Look, there he goes-that wretch! that villain!-I wish the ground would open this moment and sink the monster to the lowest hole in hell!" Such loathing was exacerbated when the King's adoption of a Hanoverian mistress became public knowledge, so helping to make the Prince the more popular member of the Royal Family. Pitt, as a young MP and army officer, became part of the Prince's circle, with some of his early parliamentary speeches being unmistakably toadying towards the Prince. He became a regular opponent of Walpole, and was dismissed from his position in the army as a result.<br><br>A study of the rise to power of the elder Pitt over the subsequent twenty years provides four main conclusions which assist in appreciating the career of his son. First, elections in the eighteenth century were not contested by organised political parties with a programme or manifesto. Although in the mid-eighteenth century many politicians could still be roughly categorised as Whig or Tory, even this distinction was breaking down. The opposit...</p><h2>Hunting Badger</h2><p><p>Three men raid the gambling casino run by the Ute nation and then disappear into the maze of canyons on the Utah-Arizona border. When the FBI, with its helicopters and high-tech equipment, focuses on a wounded deputy sheriff as a possible suspect, Navajo Tribal Police Sergeant Jim Chee and his longtime colleague, retired Lieutenant Joe Leaphorn, launch an investigation of their own. Chee sees a dangerous flaw in the federal theory; Leaphorn sees intriguing connections to the exploits of a legendary Ute bandit-hero. And together, they find themselves caught up in the most perplexing&#x2014;and deadly&#x2014;criminal manhunt of their lives.</p></p><p>The marvelous <i>Hunting Badger</i> is Tony Hillerman's 14th novel featuring Navajo tribal police officers Joe Leaphorn and Jim Chee. Here the two cops (who appeared in separate books early on but whose paths now cross routinely) are working two angles of the same case to catch the right-wing militiamen who pulled off a violent heist at an Indian casino. Hillerman serves up plenty of action and enough plot twists to keep readers off balance, leading up to a satisfyingly tense climax in which Leaphorn and Chee stalk a killer in his hideout. But through it all, the cardinal Hillerman virtues are in evidence: economical, pellucid prose; a panoply of Indian-country characters who seem to rise right up off the page; vivid evocations of the Southwest's bleak beauty; and rich insights into Navajo life and culture. (Hillerman once told an interviewer that the highest compliment he'd ever received was many Navajo readers' assumption that he himself is Navajo--he's not.)<p> While first-time readers will find plenty to enjoy in <i>Hunting Badger</i>, it holds special pleasures for longtime fans. There's more and deeper contact between Leaphorn and Chee, and we continue to see further into the prickly Leaphorn's human side (though without fuss or sentimentality). Chee finally begins to get over Janet Pete (it took about six books) and inch toward a new love interest. And in a moving section involving Chee's spiritual teacher Frank Sam Nakai, the shaman provides a key insight into the case.</p><p> In a world teeming with "sense of place" mysteries--set in Seattle, Alaska, the Arizona desert, or Chicago--it can be a shock to return to Hillerman, who started it all, and realize just how superior he is to the rest of the pack. <i>--Nicholas H.

When a murder takes place, Meg realizes that she and her boyfriend can no longer sit by a cozy fireplace, but must instead tramp around the muddy island to keep try and clear her father who is the chief suspect. <br></p><p>Meg Langslow and her boyfriend Michael want to be alone, but fate's conspired to make it all but impossible. Meg takes her aunt Phoebe up on an invitation to spend an Indian summer weekend at Phoebe's supposedly empty cottage on the coast of Maine. Braving a hurricane and a horde of determined birdwatchers, they make the last ferry to Monhegan Island, only to find their plans to be alone dashed by the unexpected appearance of Meg's entire family, including Aunt Phoebe. To make matters worse, a famous and slightly megalomaniacal sculptor, who may have been Meg's mother's lover years ago, has taken up residence on the island. When he's killed in an accident that turns out to be murder, Meg's sweet, slightly dotty father is fingered as the suspect. The elusive puffin, revered by bird lovers and captured in kitsch by an island artist named Rhapsody, is the leitmotif in this charming cozy, the second outing in author Donna Andrews's series. The first book, <i>Murder with Peacocks</i>, won the Agatha Award for the best first traditional mystery. <i>Murder with Puffins</i> is a bit short on drama and suspense, though long on charm. Meg and Michael are appealing, but the minor characters, especially Meg's parents and the colorful island locals, are infinitely more interesting. <i>--Jane Adams</i><p><b>Donna Andrews</b> is the author of the Meg Langslow mysteries, including <i>Stork Raving Mad</i> and <i>Swan for the Money</i>.

His hands were the size of potholders, even under the suit jacket his shoulders were round melons. Quinten was a brown man but there was a lot of red under the skin. It was almost as if he were rage-colored. </p><p> As Quinten strode across the lawn he crushed a patch of chives that I'd been growing for seven years. </p><p> The violent-colored man smiled at me. He held out his beefy paw and said, "Glad I caught you in." </p><p> "Uh-huh." I stepped down to meet him. I shook his hand and looked into his eyes. </p><p> When I didn't say anything there was an uncomfortable moment for the Los Angeles police sergeant. He stared up into my face wanting me to ask him why he was there. But all I wanted was for him to leave me to go back into my home with my wife and children. </p><p> "Is this your baby?" he asked. Quinten was from back east, he spoke like an educated white Northerner. </p><p> "Yeah." </p><p> "Beautiful child." </p><p> "Yeah. She sure is." </p><p> "She sure is," Quinten repeated. "Takes after her mother, I bet." </p><p> "What do you want wit' me, officer?" I asked. </p><p> "I want you to come with me." </p><p> "I'm under arrest?" </p><p> "No. No, not at all, Mr. Rawlins." </p><p> I knew when he called me mister that the LAPD needed my services again. Every once in a while the law sent over one of their few black representatives to ask me to go into the places where they could never go. I was worth a precinct full of detectives when the cops needed the word in the ghetto. </p><p> "Then why should I wanna go anywhere wit' you? Here I am spendin' the day wit' my fam'ly. I don't need no Sunday drive wit' the cops." </p><p> "We need your help, Mr. Rawlins." Quinten was becoming visibly more crimson under his brown shell. </p><p> I wanted to stay home, to be with my wife, to make love to her later on. But something about Naylor's request kept me from turning him down. There was a kind of defeat in the policeman's plea. Defeat goes down hard with black people; it's our most common foe. </p><p> "Where we gonna go?" </p><p> "It's not far. Twelve blocks. Hundred and Tenth Street." He turned as he spoke and headed for the street. </p><p> I yelled into the house, "I'm goin' fo' a ride with Officer Naylor. I'll be back in a while." </p><p> "What?" Regina called from her ironing board out back. </p><p> "I'm goin' out for a while," I yelled. Then I waved at my forty-foot avocado tree. </p><p> Little Jesus peeked out from his perch up there and smiled. </p><p> "Come on down here," I said. </p><p> The little Mexican boy climbed down the tree and ran up to me with a silent smile stitched across his face. He had the face of an ancient American, dark and wise. </p><p> "I don't want you off exploring today, Jesus," I said. "Stay around here and look after your mother and Edna." </p><p> Jesus looked at his feet and nodded. </p><p> "Look up here at me." I did all the talking when around Jesus because he hadn't said a word in the eight years I'd known him. </p><p> Jesus squinted up at me. </p><p> "I want you close to home. Understand me?" </p><p> Quinten was at his car, looking at his watch. </p><p> Jesus nodded, looking me in the eye this time. </p><p> "All right." I rubbed his crew-cut peach fuzz and went out to meet the cop.</p><p> </p><p> Officer Naylor drove me to an empty lot in the middle of the 1200 block of 110th Street. There was an ambulance parked out front, flanked by patrol cars. I noticed a bright patent-leather white pump in the gutter as we crossed the street. </p><p> A crowd had gathered on the sidewalk. Seven white police officers stood shoulder to shoulder across the front of the property, keeping everybody out. The feeling was festive. The policemen were all at ease, smoking cigarettes and joking with the Negro gawkers. </p><p> The lot itself was decorated with two rusted-out Buicks that were hunkered down on broken axles in the weeds. A knotty oak had died toward the back end of the lot. </p><p> Quinten and I walked through the crowd. There were men, women, and children stretching their necks and bobbing back and forth. A boy said, "Lloyd saw'er. She dead." </p><p> When we walked past the line of policemen one of them caught me by the arm and said, "Hey you, son." </p><p> Quinten gave him a hard stare and the officer said, "Oh, okay. You can go on." </p><p> Just one of the many white men I've shrugged off. His instinctive disrespect and arrogance hardly even mattered. I turned away and he was gone from my life. </p><p> "Right this way, Mr. Rawlins," Quinten Naylor said. </p><p> There were four plainclothes policemen looking down at the back of the tree. I couldn't make out what it was that they saw. </p><p> I recognized one of the cops. He was a burly white man, the kind of fat man who was fat everywhere, even in his face and hands. </p><p> "Mr. Rawlins," the burly man said. He held out a pillowy hand. </p><p> "You remember my partner," Quinten said. "Roland Hobbes." </p><p> We'd come around the tree by then. There was a woman in a pink party dress, a little open at the breast, sitting with her back against the trunk. Her legs were straight out in front of her, a little apart. Her head tilted to the side, away from me, and her hands were on either side of her thighs with the palms up. Her left foot sported a white pump, her right foot was bare. </p><p> I remember the softness and the underlying strength of Roland Hobbes's hand and the insect I saw perched on the woman's temple. I wondered why she didn't bat it away. </p><p> "Nice to see you," I was saying to Hobbes when I realized that the insect was a dried knot of blood. </p><p> When Roland let go of my hand he listed toward Quinten and said, "Same thing." </p><p> "Both?" Quinten asked. </p><p> Roland nodded. </p><p> The girl was young and pretty. It was hard for me to think that she was dead. It seemed as if she might get up from there any minute and smile and tell me her name. </p><p> Somebody whispered, "Third one." </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � by 1992 by Walter Mosley</p></p><h2>Dictionary of Premillennial Theology: A Practical Guide to the People, Viewpoints, and History of Prophetic Studies</h2><p>More than fifty scholars combine their expertise to present a historical and topical dictionary of premillennial theology.</p><p>Mal Couch (Th.M., Dallas Theological Seminary, Th.D., Lousiana Baptist Seminary) is founder and president of Tyndale Theological Seminary and Biblical Institute in Fort Worth, Texas.

A staple ingredient in traditional Jewish cuisine, schmaltz (or rendered chicken fat), is at risk of disappearing from use due to modern dietary trends and misperceptions about this versatile and flavor-packed ingredient.<br>THE BOOK OF SCHMALTZ acts as a primer on schmaltz, taking a fresh look at traditional dishes like kugel, kishke, and kreplach, and also venturing into contemporary recipes that take advantage of the versatility of this marvelous fat. Potatoes cooked with schmaltz take on a crispness and satisfying flavor that vegetable oil can't produce. Meats and starches have a depth and complexity that set them apart from the same dishes prepared with olive oil or butter.<br>What's more, schmaltz provides a unique link to the past that ought to be preserved. "Schmaltz is like a thread that runs through a great tapestry," says Ruhlman's neighbor Lois, whose cooking inspired his own journey into the world of schmaltz. "It's a secret handshake among Jews who love to cook and eat."</p><p>Michael Ruhlman's innovative and successful food reference books include <i>Ratio</i>, <i>The Elements of Cooking</i>,<i> Ruhlman's Twenty</i>, and<i> Charcuterie</i>. He has appeared as a judge on <i>Iron Chef </i>and as a featured guest on Anthony Bourdain's <i>No Reservations</i>. He has also co-authored books with Thomas Keller, Eric Ripert, and Michael Symon. He lives in Cleveland, Ohio, with his wife, photographer Donna Turner Ruhlman."The foundation of the book is, of course, Ruhlman's schmaltz recipe, which is extraordinarily easy. Six steps, 90 minutes, and you're in business. Classics such as chopped liver, kreplach, and potato kugel follow, as do unconventional dishes including vichyssoise with gribenes and chives-and-chicken confit. They're now yours for the making."&#x2015;<b><i>--David Leite, <i>Leite's Culinaria</i></i></b><br><br>"Ruhlman, who has authored cookbooks with culinary greats like Thomas Keller and Michael Symon, puts his own spin on even the most classic recipes."&#x2015;<b><i>--Katherine Martinelli, <i>The Jewish Daily Forward</i></i></b><br><br>"If for some reason you never thought frying chicken fat could be made beautiful, you really need to check this out."&#x2015;<b><i>--Russ Parsons, <i>Los Angeles Times</i></i></b><br><br>"Sometimes it takes and outsider to see a subject clearly. That is what Michael Ruhlman has done with schmaltz, portraying this much-maligned fat thorugh his lens and that of Lois Baron, a friendly Jewish neighbor and a traditionalist in the kitchen. <i>Mazel tov </i>on the results!"&#x2015;<b><i>--Joan Nathan, author of <i>Jewish Cooking in America</i></i></b><br><br>"It's about time that schmaltz got its due. And from, no less, a great food writer who isn't Jewish. Michael Ruhlman understands, as too many Jews don't, that Yiddish cooking is a worthy cuisine, deserving of attention and respect - not to mention the carefully composed recipes and gorgeous photographs you'll find in this book."&#x2015;<b><i>--Arthur Schwartz, author of <i>Jewish Home Cooking: Yiddish Recipes Revisited</i></i></b></p><h2>Murder by the Book</h2><p>When everyone who has read Leonard Dykes's unpublished manuscript--including the author himself--is found dead, Nero Wolfe, along with his sidekick, decides to set a trap. Reissue. <i>NYT. </i></p><p>DeceasedNero Wolfe and his sidekick, Archie, connect the dots between three seemingly unconnected murders, as always a step ahead of the chronically baffled and frustrated Inspector Cramer. Linking the murders of a law clerk, an editor, and a typist is a missing book manuscript with potentially damaging information about a prominent law firm. Narrator Michael Prichard has Wolfe, Archie, and Cramer down pat, and does justice to the supporting cast of quirky women and men. Prichard shifts smoothly from one to another and keeps the story moving at a pace that never lags while allowing listeners time to absorb the intricacies of plot. This absorbing 1940s mystery will entertain Stout fans and newcomers alike.

Titmuss&#39;s The Gift Relationship has long been acknowledged as one of the classic texts on social policy. A seemingly straightforward comparative study of blood donating in the United States and Britain, the book elegantly raises profound economic, political, and philosophical questions. Titmuss contrasts the British system of reliance on voluntary donors to the American one in which the blood supply is largely in the hands of for-profit enterprises and shows how a nonmarket system based on altruism is more effective than one that treats human blood as another commodity.</p><p>Richard M. Titmuss was a professor of social administration at the London School of Economics form 1950 until his death in 1973. He had an international reputation as an uncompromising analyst of contemporary social policy and as an expert on the welfare state.

This roller coaster season of football includes the infamous Catholics vs. Convicts game (Notre Dame vs. Jimmy Johnson's #1 ranked Miami Hurricanes).

Tears rolled down some of the young men&#x2019;s faces, an uncontrolled emotional response after launching into battle. <br>The days of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish playing the role of the nice weakling had ended. <br>Leaving the field after pregame warm-ups, the Miami Hurricanes chose to go through a line of Notre Dame players, rather than go around them. Miami met an unflinching Irish squad. <br>The Hurricanes, the No. 1 team in the country and the best program of the era, had been the chief tormentor of the Irish in recent years. In the schools&#x2019; previous two meetings Miami humbled Notre Dame by a total score of 82&#x2013;7. Flashy on-field celebrations deepened the embarrassment doled out by the &#x2019;Canes. <br>Now Miami had traveled to Notre Dame Stadium, and the showy, bullying antics would not be tolerated. When the &#x2019;Canes breached the Notre Dame warm-up line, a fight exploded on the ground separating the end zone and the stadium&#x2019;s lone tunnel. <br>&#x201c;It was a melee. It wasn&#x2019;t like guys fighting in a bar where they want someone to break it up. We did not care if someone broke it up. We wanted to take them there,&#x201d; Notre Dame starting strong safety George Streeter said years later. &#x201c;Quite frankly, for me, I wasn&#x2019;t paying attention to the score. I wanted to win the fight.&#x201d; <br>Stadium security and law enforcement officers stepped in to end it. <br>Both teams withdrew to their locker rooms. <br>Fifth-year senior Wes Pritchett, the middle linebacker who called the plays in the Irish defensive huddle, threw his helmet across the room. <br>Spit flew from Frank Stams&#x2019;s mouth as the outside linebacker pumped up the defense that had gathered around him. <br>Blood rushed to the hands of quarterback Tony Rice, who had just been throwing punches in the clash. <br>Joe Moore, Notre Dame&#x2019;s grizzled offensive line coach, who had graduated summa cum laude from football&#x2019;s old school, cracked a green slate chalkboard with a kick. <br>&#x201c;The whole thing put me in a fighting mood,&#x201d; said Andy Heck, a quiet team captain and the starting offensive tackle. <br>The room grew quiet when head coach Lou Holtz addressed the team. The words that came out of his mouth were unexpected, a character departure, and they recharged the enraged atmosphere that had been subdued by his presence. <br>The skirmish with Miami made the statement that Notre Dame would no longer be pushed around. At the time, the Fighting Irish had not even reached the midpoint of the season. <br>By the end of the 1988 campaign, this Notre Dame squad would leave a path of battered All-American quarterbacks in its wake, give birth to legends, restore the school&#x2019;s stature in the game, win a national title, and accomplish something no other team in the history of college football has done. <br> <br> <br>&nbsp; <br>Copyright � 2013 by Jerry Barca <br></p><h2>Starlight on the Rails</h2><p>The years between the end of World War II and the mid-1960s saw a flowering of railroad photography in America.

After all, reputation is everything in this business. Personally, he&#x2019;s not exactly upset that Ralph is gone, but as a high profile doctor to the stars, Marc can't hide from the truth forever. <br><br>It all started the previous summer. Marc, his wife, and their two beautiful teenage daughters agreed to spend a week at the Meier&#x2019;s extravagant summer home on the Mediterranean. Joined by Ralph and his striking wife Judith, her mother, and film director Stanley Forbes and his much younger girlfriend, the large group settles in for days of sunshine, wine tasting, and trips to the beach. But when a violent incident disrupts the idyll, darker motivations are revealed, and suddenly no one can be trusted. As the ultimate holiday soon turns into a nightmare, the circumstances surrounding Ralph&#x2019;s later death begin to reveal the disturbing reality behind that summer&#x2019;s tragedy. <br><br>Featuring the razor-sharp humor and acute psychological insight that made <i>The Dinner</i> an international phenomenon, <i>Summer House with Swimming Pool</i> is a controversial, thought-provoking novel that showcases Herman Koch at his finest.</p><p><p><b>Exclusive Q&amp;A with Author Herman Koch</b></p> <p><strong>Q. Could you explain some of the inspiration for <i>Summer House with Swimming Pool</i>? </strong></p> <p>A. At first I thought about the idea of a &#x2018;passive&#x2019; murder. In a novel, if a character wants to kill someone, they have to think about weapons and there&#x2019;s a certain amount of planning. A doctor, however&#x2014;particularly an ambivalent one like Marc Schlosser&#x2014;could murder someone simply by medical error. I found this real-life possibility intriguing.</p> <p><strong>Q. Like <i>The Dinner</i>, <i>Summer House with Swimming Pool</i> calls upon a parent&#x2019;s natural instinct to protect their children, both from external forces and from themselves. How does this theme speak to you as a writer?</strong></p> <p>A. Being a parent myself I found that this instinct to protect is stronger than anything else. In writing the two books I was curious as to how far my characters were prepared to go. Marc Schlosser in <i>Summer House</i> is only thinking in the interest of his daughters and yet, as readers we might ask ourselves if he is going too far.</p> <p><strong>Q. Your characters aren&#x2019;t always as honest with each other as they are with the reader. Do you think humans inherently struggle to tell the truth?</strong></p> <p>A. I think we all try to function in a certain role. We are interested in what other people think about us, and most of the time we try to have control over the outside image we are trying to present. What we really think, and what&#x2014;in a novel&#x2014;I feel free to tell a reader, is a different story altogether.</p> <p><strong>Q. <i>The Dinner</i> takes place over a few hours&#x2014;and courses&#x2014;in a chic restaurant. The action of Summer House sprawls across a summer and is set in several locations including Amsterdam, a beach along the Mediterranean, and finally, the United States. How much of a role did setting play in <i>Summer House</i>?</strong></p> <p>A. Though it might not end up as a specific description in my books, I&#x2019;m always thinking of a concrete setting, a place I know very well&#x2014;I have to know exactly in which summerhouse we are staying and what the swimming pool looks like and how far it is from the house. Also where the nearest beach is, where characters would go to do their shopping, etc. The exact place is less important. Some European readers of <i>Summer House</i> think it&#x2019;s set in the south of France, while others place the story in Italy or northern Spain. I know where it is: I&#x2019;ve been there myself.</p> <p><strong>Q. Which of your characters do you think is the most relatable, if any? </strong></p> <p>A. I always try to feel sympathy for all of my characters, even if they do terrible things. If not, they become two-dimensional monsters. I want them to be real-life people, although we might condemn what they do, we should at least be able to understand why they do it under the circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Q. How did your background as an actor inform the way you wrote Ralph Meier? </strong></p> <p>A. Well, I have met actors like Ralph Meier. I drank beer with them at the bar and listened to their stories. And I thought: <i>one day you will end up in a book of mine</i>.</p> <p><strong>Q. What&#x2019;s next for you?</strong></p> <p>A. My next novel, <i>Dear Mr. M</i>, just came out here in The Netherlands the first week of May. It&#x2019;s about a formerly-bestselling writer, M, who is now very old and almost forgotten. Forty years ago he wrote a successful novel loosely based on facts, in which a school teacher disappears forever. Two schoolchildren were accused of having had a hand in this, but there was no proof. Now, at the end of his career, the disappearance case returns to haunt him.</p>HERMAN KOCH is the author of eight novels and three collections of short stories. <i>The Dinner</i>, his sixth novel, has been published in twenty-five countries, and was an international bestseller. He currently lives in Amsterdam.</p><h2>The Hand of Dinotopia</h2><p>Will and Sylvia search for the mysterious Hand of Dinotopia, which will supposedly lead to a safe sea route to and from the hidden island where people and dinosaurs live together peacefully. Reprint.</p><p>Alan Dean Foster is the author of <i>Dinotopia Lost,</i> and <i>The Hand of Dinotopia,</i> which are based on <i>Dinotopia</i> and <i>Dinotopia: The World Beneath,</i> written and illustrated by James Gurney. Mr. Foster has writtennovelizations of many popular fantasy and science fiction films, including <i>Star Wars</i> and the <i>Alien</i> films. He and his family live in Prescott, AZ.Grade 5-8-Following up on Dinotopia Lost (HarperCollins, 1998) with this doorstopper sequel set in the idyllic land of intelligent dinosaurs created by Gurney, Foster sends his intrepid protagonists Will and Sylvia from harsh desert to steamy rain forest in search of the fabled Hand-rumored to be a key to the sole safe passage between Dinotopia and the outside world. As can be expected from this veteran author, it's a smoothly crafted tale with an entertainingly contentious supporting cast, grandly formal language ("You claim there is something out there, Sylvia. Let us go and find it"), and replete with jawbreaking dinosaur nomenclature and a plot urged along at a steady, if deliberate, pace by well-timed adventures and discoveries. What makes this effort practically unique among epic fantasy is its lack of an evil adversary. Aside from an encounter with a threatening band of painted, spear-bearing deinonychids, the weaponless expedition faces only the occasional flash flood, giant centipede, or other natural hazard. Ultimately, the quest is successful, but with the revelation that the Hand's passage was concealed after an ancient war with human invaders, Will, Sylvia, and their scaled companions turn back in dismay-until the next sequel, perhaps. The story's (mostly) gentle dinosaurs and underlying pacificism make a rare break from the swords-and-monsters routine.<br><i>John Peters, New York Public Library</i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Death of King Arthur: The Immortal Legend</h2><p><p><b> Acclaimed biographer Peter Ackroyd vibrantly resurrects the legendary epic of Camelot in this modern adaptation. </b></p><p>The names of Arthur, Merlin, Lancelot, Guinevere, Galahad, the sword of Excalibur, and the court of Camelot are as recognizable as any from the world of myth. Although many versions exist of the stories of King Arthur and the Knights of the Round Table, <i>Le Morte d'Arthur</i> by Sir Thomas Malory endures as the most moving and richly inventive. In this abridged retelling the inimitable Peter Ackroyd transforms Malory's fifteenth-century work into a dramatic modern story, vividly bringing to life a world of courage and chivalry, magic, and majesty. The golden age of Camelot, the perilous search for the Holy Grail, the love of Guinevere and Lancelot, and the treachery of Arthur's son Mordred are all rendered into contemporary prose with Ackroyd's characteristic charm and panache. Just as he did with his fresh new version of Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, Ackroyd now brings one of the cornerstones of English literature to a whole new audience.</p></p><p><p>Peter Ackroyd is an award-winning novelist, critic, and biographer.</p> <br><b>Sir Thomas Malory</b> was a knight and estate owner in the mid 15th century, who spent many years in prison for political crimes as well as robbery. He wrote <b>Le Morte d&#x2019;Arthur</b>, the first great English prose epic, while imprisoned in Nwgate. The epic was published in 1485 by William Caxton, the first English printer. Malory is believed to have died in 1471.I thought Peter Ackroyd&#39;s Morte d&#39;A was masterful. The quality I admired most was the absolute clarity of the storytelling. This story - or set of stories - has to move with both swiftness and dignity, and yoking those two qualities together is not an easy task; but Ackroyd does it with ease. I think he can probably do anything. I admire this version enormously. Phillip Pullman Peter Ackroyd&#39;s lightly trimmed and streamlines Le Morte d&#39;Arthur makes it eminently readable Sunday Times &#39;In this ingenious decanting of an old wine into a new bottle, [Peter Ackroyd] he has taken a glorious part of our cultural heritage and made it more accessible to the readers of the 21st century. &#39; -- David Robson Sunday Telegraph ...the majesty of Malory&#39;s book survives too, not least in the final chapters telling of the internal conflicts that destroy the Round Table, the passion of Lancelot and Guinevere, and the destiny that Arthur has had coming to him for a long time: death in battle. This, as retold by Peter Ackroyd, remains a bizarre but thrilling piece of writing. -- Michael Caines Wall Street Journal</p><h2>The Essence of Aikido: Spiritual Teachings of Morihei Ueshiba</h2><p>For the first time in English, <em>The Essence of Aikido</em> presents the profound philosophy of Aikido in Morihei's own words, disclosing many of the arcane secrets of Aikido's aims and methods. Considered by many to be the greatest martial artist and spiritual teacher of the twentieth century, Morihei provides a wealth of clues to the often puzzling nature of the inseparable link between the physical and spiritual aspects of Aikido, revealing the heart of the peaceful warrior's art. <br><br>Elegantly translated and compiled by John Stevens, translator of Morihei's <em>Budo</em>, the first half of <em>The Essence of Aikido</em> presents the most comprehensive collection of the writings of Morihei Ueshiba ever published. Key concepts in Aikido philosophy, such as kototama (language of the spirit) and misogi (purification of body and mind) are discussed at length, profusely illustrated with Morihei's mystical diagrams, spiritual poems, and fascinating calligraphy. <br><br>For Morihei, techniques were the means to express the spiritual principles of Aikido, and in the second half of <em>The Essence of Aikido</em>, John Stevens focuses on Morihei's techniques. Over two hundred hitherto unpublished photos of Morihei in action from his earliest days as a teacher of the martial arts to his last years as a master of Aikido complete this detailed survey of the true nature of Aikido. <br><br>A major contribution to a field that until recently has remained elusive to Western readers, <em>The Essence of Aikido</em> is an inspiring study of the spiritual and physical elements in Aikido, providing an important resource for martial arts practitioners and philosophy students alike.</p><p><br>MORIHEI UESHIBA, born in Western Japan in 1883, is the founder of the popular martial art of Aikido. After mastering classical styles of judo, kendo, and jujutsu, he created Aikido, based on the spiritual teachings of the Omoto-kyo religion. After the Second World War, Morihei established the Aikikai Foundation to promote Aikido throughout the world.

In November 1917, Lenin&#39;s Bolsheviks (later known as &#39;Soviets&#39;) seized power, signed a peace treaty with the Central Powers and brutally murdered Tsar Nicholas (British King George&#39;s first cousin) and his children so there could be no return to the old order. As Russia fractured into loyalist &#39;White&#39; and revolutionary &#39;Red&#39; factions, the British government became increasingly drawn into the escalating Russian Civil War after hundreds of thousands of German troops transferred from the Eastern Front to France were used in the 1918 &#39;Spring Offensive&#39; which threatened Paris. What began with the landing of a small number of Royal Marines at Murmansk in March 1918 to protect Allied-donated war stores quickly escalated with the British government actively pursuing an undeclared war against the Bolsheviks on a number of fronts in support of British trained and equipped &#39;White Russian&#39; Allies. At the height of British military intervention in mid-1919, British troops were fighting the Soviets far into the Russian interior in the Baltic, North Russia, Siberia, Caspian and Crimea simultaneously. The full range of weapons in the British arsenal were deployed including the most modern aircraft, tanks and even poison gas. British forces were also drawn into peripheral conflicts against &#39;White&#39; Finnish troops in North Russia and the German &#39;Iron Division&#39; in the Baltic. It remains a little known fact that the last British troops killed by the German Army in the First World War were killed in the Baltic in late 1919, nor that the last Canadian and Australian soldiers to die in the First World War suffered their fate in North Russia in 1919 many months after the Armistice. Despite the award of five Victoria Crosses (including one posthumous) and the loss of hundreds of British and Commonwealth soldiers, sailors and airmen, most of whom remain buried in Russia, the campaign remains virtually unknown in Britain today. After withdrawal of all British forces in mid-1920, the British government attempted to cover up its military involvement in Russia by classifying all official documents. By the time files relating to the campaign were quietly released decades later there was little public interest. Few people in Britain today know that their nation ever fought a war against the Soviet Union. The culmination of more than 15 years of painstaking and exhaustive research with access to many previously classified official documents, unpublished diaries, manuscripts and personal accounts, author Damien Wright has written the first comprehensive campaign history of British and Commonwealth military intervention in the Russian Civil War 1918-20.</p><p>Damien Wright traces his lifelong interest in military history back to his early childhood when he was shown a photograph of his Grandfather in Australian Light Horse uniform and allowed to take his medals to school for show and tell. His interest in the British campaigns in Russia were first piqued in his teens when reading a chronological list of Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross which showed two seemingly anomalous decorations for &#39;North Russia 1919&#39; listed separately from the First World War awards. Some further digging revealed both Australian VC recipients, one of whom was a fellow South Australian, had volunteered to serve in the same unit of the British Army. Further research proved difficult, so little had ever been published and the campaign seemingly largely unknown and ignored. The product of many years of exhaustive research, Churchill&#39;s Secret War with Lenin is his first book."Superb account of the little-known involvement of Royal Marines as they engaged the new Bolsheviks (Soviets) immediately after the Russian Revolution."

She lives in England.Gloopy, gloppy, bumpy, and lumpy: Toads provide slews of onomatopoeic opportunities for writers, and plenty of potential for artists interested in drawing warts, slime, and muck. Brown (One Stormy Night, 1993, etc.) is perfect for the task. Her text exaggerates the poor toad's noxious qualities (``odorous, oozing, foul and filthy''), denigrates his cuisine of bugs, worms, and flies, and mocks his clumsy hop. When a monster appears on the scene and attempts to gobble up the toad, readers realize just what the bumps and venom are for. ``Yuuuuuck!'' screams the monster, coughing ``the happy toad, the safe toad'' back into the swamp. Brown's paintings drip with the brown and olive colors of decaying vegetation and fetid swamp stuff. She incorporates that medium's tendency to drip and glop right into her work: Splats of paint cross the toad's bumpy back, while green webbed footprints splash across the title pages. Observant readers will spot the approaching monster long before toad does, heightening the anticipation of the inevitable--though failed--tryst. The endpapers match the amphibious decor, displaying a brocade of frog eggs. Exquisitely slimy. (Picture book. 3-6) -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

He has also worked as a writer/researcher for music programs on the cable network VH1.<br>David Leaf is a rock journalist who has written biographies of the BeeGees and the Beach Boys, among others.<br>With its combination of cartoonish monster-movie makeup and oversized costumes, ear-splitting amplification and gleeful songs in praise of sex, heavy metal rock legend Kiss has never been accused of not being excessive, and this book is a great example of why it is still a multimillion-dollar profit-making machine. While this book covers much of the same biographical territory as Gene Simmons's Kiss and Make-Up and Kisstory (the band's self-published 440-page coffee-table-sized tome), the authorized bio presents more than enough new material to make it essential for hardcore fans. Much of the book's first half presents a previously unpublished work based on the only in-depth interviews the band gave in 1980. The result is a remarkably humanizing look behind the heavy metal tomfoolery, with Simmons more honestly discussing his Jewish upbringing than he does in his autobiography, and the rest of the band disarmingly admitting to borrowing from the glam-rocker New York Dolls as well as the Harlem Globetrotters. The book's second half, however, is the true highlight for Kiss fans: a comprehensive look at all of the Kiss albums ever made. Among the surprises is the praise of noted producer Eddie Kramer, a close associate of Jimi Hendrix, for the band's no-nonsense work ethic. Of note are Kiss's hilariously guileless quotes, such as the admission that another producer "made a point of trying to get us to stop writing songs about getting laid, which was valid.

Ayers. Born in 1899, she writes about herself: One of eleven children, I was born on a rocky farm squeezed between the Black Mountains and the Poor Fork River in Harlan County, Kentucky (More About Junior Authors). A few years later the family moved to Tennessee. While she attended highschool, young Miss Caudill heard of college and decided to go to one. Having nary a penny to go on didn t strike me as an obstacle at all. She learned stenography, aided by an older sister, and with this skill, Miss Caudill was able to work her way through Wesleyan College in Macon, Georgia, the first Wesleyan student ever to work for her education. After receiving a master s degree from Vanderbilt University, she proceeded to see the world, doing teaching, office work and editing in such varied places as Rio de Janeiro, Toronto, and Nashville, Tennessee; and traveling throughout Europe. In Turkey, on the verge of signing a magazine-editing contract, she met another editor, James S. Ayers. They married and were to have two children. They lived in Urbana, Illinois, for many years. <br> Her books for younger children enlarge upon every-day pleasures and difficulties with a sense of wonder and freshness. Happy Little Family and the three further novels that trace the same family s life in succeeding years are fine representatives of the author s appeal to young readers. She has also written with charm for the youngest children in books like A Pocket Full of Cricket and A Certain Small Shepherd this last being a Christmas story, illustrated by William Pene du Bois.

What greeted me instead was the lingering stench of ashes and the empty sockets of our ruined home.</i> Samuel Puterman on his return to Warsaw, 19451;2 <br>&nbsp; <i>We could see the physical destruction but the effect of vast economic disruption and political, social, and psychological destruction ... completely escaped us.</i> Dean Acheson, US Under-Secretary of State, 1947 1 Physical Destruction In 1943 the travel book publisher Karl Baedeker produced a guide to the Generalgouvernement -- that part of central and southern Poland that remained nominally separate from the Reich. As with all publications in Germany at the time, it was just as concerned with disseminating propaganda as with giving its readers information. The section on Warsaw was a case in point. The book waxed lyrical about the city's German origins, its German character and the way that it had become one of the world's great capitals 'predominantly through the effort of Germans'. It urged tourists to visit the medieval Royal Castle, the fourteenth-century cathedral and the beautiful late-Renaissance Jesuit Church - all the products of German culture and influence. Of special interest was the complex of late baroque palaces around Pilsudski Square - 'the most beautiful square in Warsaw' - now renamed Adolf Hitler Platz. The centrepiece was the 'Saxon' Palace, built of course by a German, and its beautiful Saxon Gardens, which were again designed by German architects. The travel guide conceded that one or two buildings had unfortunately been damaged by the battle for Warsaw in 1939, but since then, it reassured its readers, Warsaw 'is being rebuilt once more under German leadership'.1 No mention was made of the western suburbs of the city, which had been converted into a ghetto for Jews. This was probably just as well because even as the book was being published an uprising broke out here, obliging SS-Brigadef�hrer J�rgen Stroop to set fire to virtually every house in the district.2 Almost four square kilometres of the city were entirely destroyed in this way. The following year a second uprising broke out throughout the rest of the city. This time it was a more general insurgency inspired by the Polish Home Army. In August 1944, groups of Polish men, women and teenagers began ambushing German soldiers and stealing their weapons and ammunition. For the next two months they barricaded themselves in and around the Old City, and held down more than 17,000 German anti-insurgent troops.3 The uprising only came to an end in October after some of the most brutal fighting of the war. Afterwards, tired of Polish disobedience, and aware that the Russians were about to enter the city anyway, Hitler ordered the city to be completely razed.4 Accordingly, German troops blew up the medieval Royal Castle that had so impressed Baedeker. They undermined the fourteenth-century cathedral and blew that up too. Then they destroyed the Jesuit Church. The Saxon Palace was systematically blown up over the course of three days just after Christmas 1944, as was the entire complex of baroque and rococo palaces. The European Hotel, recommended by Baedeker, was first burned down in October and then, just to make sure, blown up in January 1945. German troops went from house to house, street to street, systematically destroying the entire city: 93 per cent of Warsaw's dwellings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. To complete the destruction they burned down the National Archive, the Archives of Ancient Documents, the Financial Archives, the Municipal Archives, the Archives of New Documents and the Public Library.5 After the war, when the Poles were turning their thoughts to rebuilding their capital, the National Museum held an exhibition showing fragments of buildings and artworks that had been damaged or destroyed during the German occupation. They produced an accompanying guide book, which, unlike Baedeker's guide book, was written entirely in the past tense. The intention was to remind the people of Warsaw, and the wider world, of exactly what had been lost. There is a realization implicit in both the guide book and the exhibition itself that those who lived through the destruction of Warsaw were no longer able to appreciate the immensity of what had happened to their city. For them it had happened gradually, beginning with the bombardment in 1939, continuing with German looting during the occupation and ending with the destruction of the Ghetto in 1943 and the final devastation in late 1944. Now, just a few months after their liberation, they had become used to living in shells of houses, surrounded on all sides by mountains of rubble.6 In some ways the true scale of the destruction could be appreciated only by those who saw its results without actually witnessing it taking place. John Vachon was a young photographer who came to Warsaw as part of the United Nations relief effort after the war. The letters he wrote to his wife Penny in January 1946 display his complete incomprehension at the scale of the destruction. <br> This is really an incredible city and I want to give you an idea of it, and don't know how I can do it. It's a big city, see. Over one million pre war. Big as Detroit. Now it is 90 per cent <i>all</i> destroyed ... Wherever you walk here it is hunks of buildings standing up without roofs or much sides, and people living in them. Except the Ghetto, where it is just a great plain of bricks, with twisted beds and bath tubs and sofas, pictures in frames, trunks, millions of things sticking out among the bricks. I can't understand how it could have been done ... It's something that's so vicious I can't believe it.7 <br> The beautiful baroque city described by Karl Baedeker just two years earlier had completely disappeared. <br>&nbsp; It is difficult to convey in meaningful terms the scale of the wreckage caused by the Second World War. Warsaw was just one example of a city destroyed - there were dozens more within Poland alone. In Europe as a whole <i>hundreds</i> of cities had been entirely or partially devastated. Photographs taken after the war can give some idea of the scale of the destruction of individual cities, but when one tries to multiply this devastation across the entire continent it necessarily defies comprehension. In some countries - especially Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ukraine - a millennium of culture and architecture had been crushed in the space of just a few short years. The violence that brought about such total devastation has been likened by more than one historian to Armageddon. 8 Those people who witnessed the wreckage of Europe's cities struggled to come to terms even with the local devastation they saw, and it is only in their tortured, inadequate descriptions that some of the destruction becomes imaginable. However, before we come to such human reactions to the crushed and shattered scenery, it is necessary to set down some statistics - because statistics matter, regardless of how elusive they can be. As the only nation to have successfully defied Hitler for the entire duration of the war, Britain had suffered badly. The Luftwaffe had dropped almost 50,000 tons of bombs on Britain during the Blitz, destroying 202,000 houses and damaging 4.5 million more.9 The pounding received by Britain's major cities is well known, but it is what happened to some of the smaller towns that shows the true extent of the bombing. The ferocity of the attacks on Coventry gave birth to a new German verb, <i>coventriren</i> -- to 'Coventrate', or destroy utterly. Clydebank is a relatively small industrial town on the outskirts of Glasgow: out of 12,000 homes only 8 escaped damage.10 Across the English Channel the damage was not quite so universal, but much more concentrated. Caen, for example, was virtually wiped off the map when the Allies landed in Normandy in 1944: 75 per cent of the city was obliterated by Allied bombs.11 Saint-L� and Le Havre suffered even worse, with 77 per cent and 82 per cent of the buildings destroyed.12 When the Allies landed in the south of France more than 14,000 buildings in Marseilles were partly or completely destroyed.13 According to government records for compensation claims and loans for war losses, 460,000 buildings in France were destroyed in the war, and a further 1.9 million damaged.14 The further east one travelled after the war, the worse the devastation became. In Budapest 84 per cent of the buildings were damaged, and 30 per cent of them so badly that they were entirely uninhabitable.15 About 80 per cent of the city of Minsk in Belarus was destroyed: only 19 of 332 major factories in the city survived, and only then because mines set by the retreating Germans were defused by Red Army sappers just in time.16 Most of the public buildings in Kiev were mined when the Soviets retreated in 1941 -- the rest were destroyed when they returned in 1944. Kharkov in eastern Ukraine was fought over so many times that eventually there was little left to dispute. In Rostov and Voronezh, according to one British journalist, 'the destruction was very nearly 100 per cent'.17 And the list goes on. Approximately 1,700 towns and cities were devastated in the USSR, 714 of them in Ukraine alone.18 Those who travelled across this ruined landscape in the aftermath of the war saw city after city after city destroyed. Very few of these people ever attempted to describe the totality of what they had seen - instead they struggled to come to terms with the more localized damage in each single city as they came across it. Stalingrad, for example, was nothing but 'lumps of walls, boxes of half-ruined buildings, piles of rubble, isolated chimneys'.19 Sebastopol 'was now melancholy beyond words' where 'even in the suburbs ... there was hardly a house standing'.20 In September 1945 the American diplomat George F. Kennan found himself in the formerly Finnish but now Russian city of Vyborg, admiring the way that 'Rays of early morning sunshine ... caught the gutted shells of apartment buildings, and flooded them momentarily with a chill, pale gleam.' Apart from a goat that he startled in one of the ruined doorways, Kennan seemed to be the only living being in the entire city.21 At the centre of all this destruction lay Germany, whose cities undoubtedly suffered the most comprehensive damage of the war. Around 3.6 million German apartments were destroyed by the British and American air forces - that is, about a fifth of all living spaces in the country.22 In absolute terms the damage to living spaces in Germany was nearly eighteen times as bad as it was in Britain.23 Individual cities suffered far worse than the average. According to figures from the Reich's Statistical Office, Berlin lost up to 50 per cent of its habitable premises, Hanover 51.6 per cent, Hamburg 53.3 per cent, Duisburg 64 per cent, Dortmund 66 per cent, and Cologne 70 per cent.24 When Allied observers came to Germany after the war, most of them expected to find destruction on the same scale as they had witnessed in Britain during the Blitz. Even after British and American newspapers and magazines began to print pictures and descriptions of the devastation it was impossible to prepare for the sight of the real thing. Austin Robinson, for example, was sent to western Germany directly after the war on behalf of the British Ministry of Production. His description of Mainz while he was there displays his sense of shock: <br> That skeleton, with whole blocks level, huge areas with nothing but walls standing, factories almost completely gutted, was a picture that I know will live with me for life. One had known it intellectually without feeling it emotionally or humanly.25 <br> British Lieutenant Philip Dark was equally appalled by the apocalyptic vision he saw in Hamburg at the end of the war: <br> [W]e swung in towards the centre and started to enter a city devastated beyond all comprehension. It was more than appalling. As far as the eye could see, square mile after square mile of empty shells of buildings with twisted girders scarecrowed in the air, radiators of a flat jutting out from a shaft of a still-standing wall, like a crucified pterodactyl skeleton. Horrible, hideous shapes of chimneys sprouting from the frame of a wall. The whole pervaded by an atmosphere of ageless quiet ... Such impressions are incomprehensible unless seen.26 <br> There is a sense of utter despair in many of the descriptions of German cities in 1945. Dresden, for example, no longer resembled 'Florence on the Elbe' but was more like 'the face of the moon', and planning directors believed that it would take 'at least seventy years' to rebuild.27 Munich was so badly devastated that 'It truly did almost make one think that a Last Judgement was imminent.'28 Berlin was 'completely shattered - just piles of rubble and skeleton houses'.29 Cologne was a city 'recumbent, without beauty, shapeless in the rubble and loneliness of complete physical defeat'.30 Between 18 and 20 million German people were rendered homeless by the destruction of their cities - that is the same as the combined prewar populations of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.31 Another 10 million people in Ukraine were also homeless, or more than the total prewar population of Hungary.32 These people lived in cellars, ruins, holes in the ground - anywhere they could find a modicum of shelter. They were entirely deprived of essential services, such as water, gas, electricity - as were millions of others across Europe. Warsaw, for example, had just two working street lights.33 In Odessa water was only available from artesian wells, so that even visiting dignitaries were given just a single bottle per day for washing.34 Without these essential utilities the populations of Europe's cities were reduced to living, as one American columnist described it, 'in medieval fashion surrounded by the broken-down machinery of the twentieth century'.35 <br>&nbsp; While the devastation was at its most dramatic in Europe's cities, rural communities often suffered just as badly. Across the continent farms were plundered, burned, flooded or simply neglected because of the war. The marshes in southern Italy, so assiduously drained by Mussolini, were deliberately flooded again by the retreating Germans, causing a resurgence of malaria.36 More than half a million acres of Holland (219,000 hectares) were ruined when German troops deliberately opened the dykes that kept the sea at bay.37 Remoteness from the main theatres of war was no protection from such treatment. More than a third of the dwelling places in Lapland were destroyed by the retreating Germans.38 The idea was to deny the turncoat Finnish forces any shelter during the winter, but it also had the effect of creating over 80,000 refugees. Across northern Norway and Finland roads were mined, telephone lines pulled down and bridges blown up, creating problems that would be felt for years after the war was over. Once again, the further east, the worse the destruction. Greece lost a third of its forests during the German occupation, and over a thousand villages were burned and left uninhabited.39 In Yugoslavia, according to the postwar Reparations Commission, 24 per cent of the orchards were destroyed, as were 38 per cent of the vineyards and about 60 per cent of all livestock. The plundering of millions of tons of grain, milk and wool completed the ruination of the Yugoslav rural economy.40 In the USSR it was even worse: here as many as 70,000 villages were destroyed, along with their communities and the entire rural infrastructure.41 Such damage was not merely the result of fighting and casual plundering - it was caused by the systematic and deliberate destruction of land and proper...</p><h2>Morning and Evening Prayer</h2><p><p>The Order of Morning and Evening Prayer throughout the year taken from the Divine Office.</p><p>For anyone who wants to make a daily act of devotion, Morning and Evening Prayer offers the perfect combination of a consistent structure of prayer alongside daily options and choices to take you through the church&#x2019;s year.</p><p>Taken from the Catholic Divine Office, these daily prayers and readings offer inspiration for priests and lay people alike to give strength for each day.Now with a new look in the familiar hardwearing and practical format, and an updated table of moveable dates.</p></p><p></p><h2>Fading Feast: A Compendium of Disappearing American Regional Foods (Nonpareil Book)</h2><p>In the early 1980s, on assignment from the American Museum of Natural History, Raymond Sokolov crisscrossed America in search of traditional regional cuisines.

Colonel Enaak of the 5th Maa-ni-la Cavalry (composed entirely of Lemurians from the Fil-pin Lands) was intrigued by the very different reflections the sunset cast on the great Western Ocean to his left, and the equally endless (from his perspective) but more placid Lake Sirak to the right. Enaak made a trilling sound and Aasi, his viciously protective me-naak mount, ambled forward to lap water from the lake. It was a bit salty but fresh enough to drink, and despite the land bridge, it served as the boundary between General Regent Halik&#x2019;s Persia and the various Grik vice-regencies of Arabia. The border north of the great lake wasn&#x2019;t as well defined, but few Grik lived that far from the coast and borders hardly mattered. A dozen troopers accompanied Enaak on this jaunt, not really a scout, just an opportunity to get away from his HQ for some air and exercise and see the sights for a while. Even for that, however, in this land, nobody went alone. His guard detail moved up and allowed their me-naaks to drink as well.</p><p>Superficially, me-naaks, or &#x201c;meanies,&#x201d; were like giant, long-legged crocodiles with thick hides and long jaws full of razor-sharp teeth. They also wore an almost impenetrable, semisegmented protective case covering their spines and vitals. Large eyes on the sides of their heads and narrow snouts allowed excellent forward vision and depth perception. They were fast, too, as fast as the horses Enaak had heard about, serving as cavalry mounts for the Repubs from southern Africa and for the Second Fleet AEF far to the East. Having never seen a horse, Enaak could only guess which animal had greater stamina. But with their claws and teeth, a well-trained meanie had to be a better battle mount. And at least here, against the Grik, the enemy had nothing like them, and Allied cavalry enjoyed a mobility Grik could only envy.</p><p>The troopers sat their saddles, shifting and looking around for threats while their animals slurped cloudy water. Enaak trusted their diligence and allowed himself to contemplate more general matters. Arguably, he commanded the most precariously extended land force in the entire Grand Alliance. A few ships at sea might be more isolated, he reflected, but we&#x2019;ve still got the weirdest, most indefinite aassignment, on the most aam-biguous front in the waar.</p><p>Originally detailed to observe the Grik General Halik&#x2019;s retreat from Indiaa into Persia and make sure he kept on going as promised, the 5th Maa-ni-la and Colonel Dalibor Svec&#x2019;s Czech Legion, as his Brotherhood of Volunteers still called themselves (despite retaining few actual human Czechs or Slovaks&#x2014;whatever they were, and wherever they&#x2019;d come from), had shadowed Halik far longer and farther than ever expected. And they hadn&#x2019;t just watched him. On numerous occasions now, they&#x2019;d actually scouted for him and occasionally even fought the same Persian Grik. That happened most recently when Halik&#x2019;s army conquered the dead Persian Prime Regent Shighat&#x2019;s capital at Sagar. Enaak and Svec used their mounted agility to harass attempts to reinforce the city, and lobbed exploding case shot over the walls with their stubby mountain howitzers to break up concentrations of troops behind the gates.</p><p>Despite that, Colonel Svec still vigorously rebelled against any notion they were &#x201c;allied&#x201d; with Halik&#x2014;or any Grik. Enaak couldn&#x2019;t blame him. Svec&#x2019;s Czechs and their still-mysterious continental Lemurian brothers and sisters had been fighting a guerilla war against the Grik in Indiaa for decades, the &#x2019;Cats having been driven out centuries before. But as long as their vague &#x201c;treaty of nonaggression&#x201d; with Halik held, Svec was willing to be selective about which Grik he killed. Enaak was glad. He technically commanded the combined force, but Svec&#x2019;s people hadn&#x2019;t joined the United Homes and even their connection to the Grand Alliance was tenuous. Enaak sensed a palpable paranoia on Svec&#x2019;s part about alliances in general, based on a very old betrayal. But until they reached Sutkag, on the extreme southwest coast of Persia, and Enaak&#x2019;s 5th Maa-ni-la was finally reinforced (and resupplied!) by ships from Madraas, he&#x2019;d been significantly outnumbered by Svec&#x2019;s detachment of the Czech Legion. If Svec had chosen not to honor the treaty, there wasn&#x2019;t much Enaak could&#x2019;ve done. Now the 5th had swelled to almost four thousand troopers&#x2014;brigade strength for a regiment&#x2014;and combined with the Czechs (human and Lemurian), Enaak practically had a division. But that still didn&#x2019;t make Svec any easier to handle.</p><p>Enaak glanced northeast, back in the direction of their large, isolated encampment several miles away. Field fortifications surrounded the neatly ordered lines of tiny tents. The laand here isn&#x2019;t thaat different from places in the Fil-pin Laands, he mused wistfully, taking in the tall-grass savanna, interspersed with large clumps of high, narrow-trunked trees. There were hills nearby, and hazy purple, snow-capped mountains brooded in the distance. Closer, a small column of Svec&#x2019;s troopers could be seen; one of the official scout details. They were angling closer, the lumbering gait of their tall kravaas belying how quickly the big herbivores could move. Kravaas and me-naaks didn&#x2019;t like each other, but given their size and power, and the long horns kravaas wore all over their bony heads, the outcome of any duel between one of them and a me-naak was always a toss-up. Since most of those present had been around each other a while, few such altercations occurred. They remained wary, cooperative adversaries. Kind of like us and Haalik, Enaak mused.</p><p>He resumed daydreaming of a home he hadn&#x2019;t seen in two long years. I&#x2019;m told it&#x2019;s more thaan six thousaands of miles away, he thought. And though I&#x2019;ve certainly traaveled it, I caan&#x2019;t even imaagine such a distaance. He gazed back at Lake Sirak, its waves glistening under the dimming rays like those of Maa-ni-la Bay, and stretching beyond the horizon to the northwest. Svec says this lake was paart of the ocean where he came from. Something caalled the Persiaan Gulf. He sighed. He&#x2019;d seen a lot of the world in the past two years, a world infinitely larger and more complicated than he&#x2019;d ever suspected. Particularly when informed by the perspectives of those who&#x2019;d seen another one entirely.</p><p>Aasi raised her head and snorted, water dripping from long teeth. Snorting again, she stepped back from the shore. Preoccupied, Enaak assumed she&#x2019;d had her fill. Few things frightened me-naaks, but no land animal tarried needlessly long near water on this world. Virtually everything beneath it was dangerous&#x2014;as were some things that had adapted to hunt from it&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Col-nol!&#x201d; came a cry from Enaak&#x2019;s right. He spun to look at one of his troopers and immediately realized his mistake. The cav-&#x2019;Cat already had his carbine up and was pointing it at the water. Aasi crouched, jaws agape. None of the 5th burdened their mounts with muzzles anymore; their meanies had grown too attached to them to eat them, so why sacrifice one of their best defenses? Fully half of Enaak&#x2019;s troopers fired at the sudden explosion of spray in front of them, proving they&#x2019;d remained more alert than their commander. Dashing out of the splashing cascade up on land was what looked very much like a me-naak&#x2014;only it was easily three times as big and had eyes on top of its head. That&#x2019;s how it crept so close unseen.</p><p>It had also just shrugged off half a dozen hits from .50-80 caliber Allin-Silva carbines as it lunged with open jaws for one of the troopers. As quick as the monster was, however, the meanies&#x2019; reflexes were faster and they bolted from the attack. Apparently even less attentive than Enaak, though, one trooper tumbled from his saddle and dropped to the ground in front of the beast. It began to stoop. A second flurry of shots distracted it&#x2014;and the trooper&#x2019;s own mount slammed into it with the force of a torpedo, jaws snapping closed on a longish neck. To survive in the water, however, the creature&#x2019;s hide must&#x2019;ve been at least as tough as a me-naak&#x2019;s case, and it batted the smaller attacker away. It hit hard and rolled, knocking down another me-naak and its rider, who screamed when his leg was crushed.</p><p>Enaak now had his own carbine up, aiming at the thing&#x2019;s eyes, but they were relatively small and in constant motion. &#x201c;Baack!&#x201d; he roared. Fall baack!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But, Col-nol!&#x201d; First Sergeant Liaa-Binaa cried helplessly, firing again. They had people on the ground in front of that thing!</p><p>&#x201c;Fall baack fifty tails. Thaat&#x2019;s an order. Then keep firing.&#x201d; Enaak insisted. He finally fired himself, missing the eye, but probably hitting the thing somewhere in the head. It screeched and turned to face him. The .50-80 cartridge the Grand Alliance adopted for its standard Allin-Silva &#x201c;trapdoor&#x201d; infantry rifles and carbines was a potent round; very accurate out to 200, even 300 tails (or yards) in the hands of any well-trained troop. Many soldiers could double that, and a talented few could triple it. Its big, heavy bullet would normally get good penetration on large, dangerous beasts and often killed multiple Grik in massed formations.</p><p>But this thing seemed particularly well armored, quickly flattening the slugs on impact and preventing them from going deep. And its head must be extra haard! Enaak thought as he flipped the breech of his carbine open, ejecting the spent shell over his shoulder and quickly inserting a fresh one. He cocked the hammer and aimed again. Aasi stood rigidly beneath him while the rest of her kind and their riders loped a short distance to the rear. Enaak felt a surge of gratitude and affection for the animal that had tried to eat him when they were first paired.</p><p>The first fallen trooper had taken his chance and scampered to join the others on foot, but the other was trapped under his fallen me-naak, struggling to rise under the weight of another that was dead or stunned. The &#x2019;Cat screamed as his mount writhed in panic atop his shattered leg. Dropping back on all fours, the water monster surged toward the wounded prey. Unaware of the firing that resumed behind him or the vip of bullets whizzing past&#x2014;and sudden shouts that refused to penetrate his concentration&#x2014;Enaak led the predator&#x2019;s protruding eye just a bit. Squeezing the trigger, the carbine bucked against his shoulder and the monster squealed horribly with a terrible volume. It spun toward him again, it&#x2019;s left eye popped like a bloody bubble. A long red crease across the top of its head showed Enaak he&#x2019;d nearly wrecked both eyes. The shouts intensified even as the monster charged toward Enaak&#x2014;and a large brown blur smashed into its side, flinging it to the ground.</p><p>Enaak blinked incredulously as another big brown shape&#x2014;a kravaa!&#x2014;barreled in and slammed its long, forward-facing phalanx of horns into the monster&#x2019;s belly. The beast squalled and rolled, vaned tail flailing, and tossed the second kravaa and its unsettled rider away. The Lemurian rider landed on his feet, his own tail whipping, and the kravaa rose a little dazedly, two of its horns snapped off. The first kravaa had quickly backed away but charged again, just as two more converged and impaled the monster. That seemed to do the trick, finally, and the beast convulsed and thrashed while blood jetted from gaping wounds. The kravaas and their riders cautiously moved a short distance back.</p><p>Colonel Enaak lowered his carbine and shouted, &#x201c;Cease firing,&#x201d; even though no one was shooting now. That&#x2019;s when he noticed his hands shaking uncontrollably. Quickly slinging the carbine, he crossed his arms over his chest, clenching them tight, and tried to control his blinking. &#x201c;Col-nol Svec,&#x201d; he called as severely as he could as the second kravaa trotted toward him. It was huffing and blowing, sides heaving, horns and ugly face covered with blood. The big man with the long, bushy beard sitting atop the animal had quite a bit of blood on him as well, though his strong white teeth gleamed through and practically glowed in the gathering twilight. &#x201c;You and your ani-maal just&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. raammed that thing yourself. I saaw you!&#x201d; Enaak continued. &#x201c;I insist thaat you refrain from such irresponsible aacts in the future. Whaat would haappen to the Legion here, and our joint efforts, if something haappened to you?&#x201d;</p><p>First Sergeant Liaa was shouting for troopers to help the wounded &#x2019;Cat, and some of Svec&#x2019;s people were dismounting to assist. Several kravaas and me-naaks, left unsupervised side by side, sniffed one another disdainfully, but there was none of the usual jostling. Colonel Dalibor Svec laughed, glancing back at the monster, which was only twitching now. &#x201c;I must ask the same of you, Colonel Enaak,&#x201d; he replied. &#x201c;In my case, Major Svec would seamlessly continue our association. (Major Ondrej Svec was Dalibor&#x2019;s son by a mother whose origin was just as murky as that of his Lemurian troops.) He chuckled darkly. &#x201c;You, on the other hand, are the only one who keeps me and my Volunteers from killing every Grik we see. If that voda plazivy got you while you sat waiting for its jaws to snap your hloupy head off, who&#x2019;d replace you, whom I&#x2019;ve learned to respect?&#x201d;</p><p>Svec had a point, and Enaak shifted uncomfortably in his saddle, his tail, somewhat embarrassingly frizzed out, whipping behind him. A lot of the 5th&#x2019;s experienced officers had been shipped south to join Colonel Saachic for operations against the Grik capital at Sofesshk, up the Zambezi River. Their replacements, arriving with the reinforcements, had little combat experience. Enaak&#x2019;s new XO, Major Nika-Paafo, had seen a little action in the New Ireland campaign, but was wounded there and had been an instructor at the Maa-ni-la ATC ever since. Enaak still wasn&#x2019;t sure how well Nika would adjust to their&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. unusual circumstances here.</p><p>A loud groan interrupted them and the two downed me-naaks finally rose and stood a little uncertainly. The one must&#x2019;ve been merely stunned after all. &#x2019;Cats picked up the wounded trooper. His leg looked bad, but it was probably a miracle from the Maker that things hadn&#x2019;t gone much worse. &#x201c;Still,&#x201d; Enaak continued to Svec, &#x201c;I wish you&#x2019;d stop paarticipating directly in these scouts. Even without Haalik&#x2019;s aarmy trying to kill us, there are maany Grik here who not only haaven&#x2019;t joined his Hunt, as they say, but don&#x2019;t even know about him. Or us, for that maatter. This is a perilous laand.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;As we were just reminded,&#x201d; Svec agreed. &#x201c;And again, I redirect the admonition to you,&#x201d; he countered, now impatient. &#x201c;That you lead from the front is one reason I like you. But as I pointed out&#x2014;and for other reasons&#x2014;you&#x2019;re even more indispensable. And if you personally lead each scout, how will your replacement officers gain the experience they need?&#x201d;</p><p>Enaak started to object that he wasn&#x2019;t scouting&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but wasn&#x2019;t that the very definition of &#x201c;seeing the sights&#x201d;? He sighed. &#x201c;Very well. Perhaaps we both might be more careful.&#x201d; He glanced at the horizon, then back toward their encampment.

At first, everything is picture perfect from the beautiful lake behind the house to the rebirth of the friendship between Travis and his brother, Adam, who lives nearby. Travis also begins to overcome the darkness of his childhood and the guilt he&#x2019;s harbored since his younger brother&#x2019;s death a tragic drowning veiled in mystery that has plagued Travis since he was 13. Soon, though, the new house begins to lose its allure. Strange noises wake Travis at night, and his dreams are plagued by ghosts. Barely glimpsed shapes flit through the darkened hallways, but strangest of all is the bizarre set of wooden stairs that rises cryptically out of the lake behind the house. Travis becomes drawn to the structure, but the more he investigates, the more he uncovers the house&#x2019;s violent and tragic past, and the more he learns that some secrets cannot be buried forever.</p><p><b>Ronald Malfi</b> is the author of <i>The Ascent</i>, <i>The Fall of Never</i>, <i>The Nature of Monsters</i>, <i>Shamrock Alley</i>, and <i>Via Dolorosa</i>.

Social psychologist Amy Cuddy advocates for the same in a book that expounds on the ideas set forth in her popular 2012 TED Talk, &#x201c;Your Body Shapes Who You Are.&#x201d; It may sound silly, but assuming the assured body language of Wonder Woman, or that &#x201c;Man Spreader&#x201d; on the bus, can literally change your body chemistry and make you feel more confident in anxiety-inducing situations. I must admit I was a bit dubious when I first heard about this, but Cuddy&#x2019;s <em>Presence</em> offers up sound science to back up her claims, and, well I tried it. Even sans the Lasso of Truth, I was less nervous about a public speaking engagement after taking Cuddy&#x2019;s advice, and was therefore more successful at that endeavor. Translate this to a first date, a job interview, even those prickly conversations you hesitate to have with loved ones...and you&#x2019;re conjuring self-confidence at the times you need it most. This is something that hits home for Cuddy, who overcame a traumatic brain injury to become a respected professor and researcher at the Harvard Business School, a feat she once thought inconceivable. Learning about the tenuous time in her life when she was paralyzed with doubts about her intellectual capacity, about how successful she could be in life, lends <em>Presence</em> a certain emotional center you don&#x2019;t find in many books of its type. &#x2013;<em>Erin Kodicek</em></p>Amy Cuddy is a Harvard Business School social psychologist.

It collects Reagan's recently discovered writings from the late 1970s, when he delivered more than a thousand radio addresses. He wrote about two-thirds of these himself, in longhand on yellow legal paper. "In writing these daily essays on almost every national policy issue during the 1970s, Reagan was acting as a one-man think tank," suggest the editors. This edition reproduces everything faithfully, right down to the spelling mistakes and crossed-out words. And it offers a compelling look at the ideas and principles that animated one of the most important Americans of the 20th century. In one address, Reagan describes his contribution to a time capsule: <blockquote> I wrote of the problems we face here in 1976--The choice we face between continuing the policies of the last 40 yrs. that have led to bigger &amp; bigger govt, less &amp; less liberty, redistribution of earnings through confiscatory taxation or trying to get back on the original course set for us by the Founding Fathers.... On the international scene two great superpowers face each other with nuclear missiles at the ready--poised to bring Armageddon to the world. </blockquote> Often his rhetoric is admirably forthright: "Calling a communist a liar when he is one is pretty frustrating. How do you insult a pig by calling it a pig?.... Fidel Castro is a liar." And there are frequent glimpses of his later achievements, such as the foreshadowing of his desire to build the Strategic Defense Initiative: "If the Soviets should push the button our magnificent warning system would immediately detect the launch of their missiles.... But there is no defense against them--no way to prevent nuclear devastation of their targets here in the U.S." <p> The bulk of the book comprises these radio addresses, but a concluding section includes everything from a short story Reagan wrote as a school assignment when he was 14 (it earned him a B+) to his memorable letter in 1994 revealing his Alzheimer's disease. This book will enthrall Reagan's devotees, and even his toughest critics will concede he had a way with words. No wonder they called him "The Great Communicator." <i>--John J.

At the center of her brilliantly original first novel is a powerful, illicit device known as the Bohr Maker, a microscopic factory full of self-replicating machines programmed to transform a human host into a genius-level nanotech engineer. Nikko, a genetically altered resident of a space colony, is reaching the end of his built-in life span and is eager to procure the Bohr Maker, as much to save his own life as to break the stranglehold of Earth's ruling Commonwealth. Before he can lay hands on it, however, the Bohr Maker's earthbound owner is killed and its tiny machinery injected into the body of an ignorant, poverty-stricken woman named Phousita, which changes the destiny of everyone in unforeseeable ways. Nagata reinforces her compelling story line with a wealth of mind-bending ideas that make her work favorably comparable with that of leading-edge stylists such as Bruce Sterling and Neal Stephenson and sure to be popular with both critics and fans. <i>Carl Hays</i></p><h2>Fine Cooking Comfort Food: 200 Delicious Recipes for Soul-Warming Meals</h2><p><p> </p><p><strong>Home cooking so good, they&#x2019;ll ask for more.</strong> You&#x2019;ll please even the pickiest eater when you serve the hearty home-style meals you&#x2019;ll find in <strong>Comfort Food</strong> from <em>Fine Cooking</em>.</p> <p><strong>No-fail recipes for all-time favorites &#x2013; and more. </strong>Here, in one cookbook, you&#x2019;ll have 200 all-time classic recipes for the meals everyone loves &#x2013; meatloaf, beef stew, macaroni and cheese &#x2013; along with modern updates and ethnic favorites.

Madsen began to be preoccupied with the lives of the Presidents of the Church, beginning with Joseph Smith. Now one of the happy results of that preoccupation is this collection of intimate biographical sketches of each of the Presidents of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, from Joseph Smith to Gordon B. Hinckley, focusing on events that helped shape each t become a great leader in the Church. <p>Brother Madsen has mined the most reliable historical sources available to tell the stories of the Church Presidents, and throughout the lectures his deep respect for these servants of the Lord is evident. Each lecture presents a fascinating biographical sketch that focuses on various events in the designated President's life, events that shaped him to become a great leader in the Church. Intriguing details regarding such matters as Wilford Woodruff's narrow escapes from death, Lorenzo Snow's experiences in Italy and in the Holy Land, Joseph F. Smith's self-taught language skills, and Heber J. Grant's sacrifices in order to help his widowed mother help listeners come to a fuller understanding of the President's backgrounds and personalities. Glimpses from journals and letters further enhance the presentations. In addition to the biographical anecdotes contained in each lecture, Brother Madsen tells of each prophet's contributions to the kingdom and gives a summary of enduring teachings. </p><p>Engaging and informative, these lectures indicate how the Presidents were both unique and alike, how each prophet was a man for his own season but also an important player in the grand progression of the gospel. From these tapes, listeners will gain a new appreciation for the Presidents of the Church and for their sacrifices and contributions to the kingdom.</p></p><p>Truman G.

Her book, Blessing the Boats (BOA Editions), won the 2000 National Book Award for Poetry. Two of Clifton&#39;s BOA poetry collections were chosen as finalists for the Pulitzer Prize in 1988. Clifton&#39;s awards include fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts and an Emmy Award.In a long career, Clifton has earned that rare combination of critical acclaim (including two Pulitzer Prize nominations) and a wide popular audience. Heir to Langston Hughes's deceptively ordinary voice, Clifton crafts brief lines and accessible metaphors into a profound and often humorous commentary on the rich survival skills of women, family love and contemporary American?particularly African American?life. Her cogent 10th collection charts a treacherous terrain of personal and historic tragedy. She confronts breast cancer with an impressive delicacy, as in "scar": "I will call you/ ribbon of hunger/ and desire/ empty pocket flap/ edge of before and after.// and you/ what will you call me?" A poetic sequence called "A Term in Memphis" penetrates Southern history, allowing the revelations of honest anger to operate as antidote?not comfort?for bigotry. Often drawn to religious themes, Clifton ambitiously explores contradictions of the Bible's King David, a poet and a soldier who "stands in the tents of history/ bloody skull in one hand, harp in the other...." With her sustaining ability to spin pain into beauty, Clifton redeems the human spirit from its dark moments. She is among our most trustworthy and gifted poets. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Eagles Who Thought They Were Chickens (English Version)</h2><p>The Eagles who Thought They were Chickens chronicles the journey of a great eagle, historically perched at the right hand of the great king in her native Africa, who is captured and taken aboard a slave ship.

(biography &amp; autobiography).</p><p><p> <strong>Amazon Best Books of the Month, November 2011</strong>: Once upon a time, there was a minor German princess named Sophia. In 1744, at the age of 14, she was taken by her ambitious mother--removed from her family, her religion, and her country--to a foreign land with a single goal: marry a prince and bear him an heir. Once in Russia, she changed her name, learned the language, and went on to become the world's richest and most powerful woman, ruler of its then-largest empire. She is remembered as Catherine the Great.<br><br> There may be no better author than Robert K. Massie to take on the daunting task of documenting this most rare of human lives. Massie, a former president of the Authors Guild, is a seasoned biographer of the 400-year Romanov dynasty, most notably with <em>Peter the Great: His Life and World</em>, which won a Pulitzer Prize in 1981 and remains one of the most arresting biographies I've even encountered.<br><br> In his page-turning chronicle of Catherine II, Massie (now 82) compiles the most complete and compelling narrative to date of this singular woman. Married to an incompetent man-child who was unwilling or unable to help her fulfill her primary role--giving birth to a son--she ultimately grew to become a trailblazer among monarchs: friend of philosophical giants, incomparable patron of the arts, prosecutor of multiple wars, pioneer of public health, maker of kings, and prodigious serial lover.<br><br> Indeed, her accomplishments and shortcomings as an autocrat and a woman make for a remarkable saga, but that's not to say that just any author could do justice to Catherine's lasting legacy. (Many have tried.) Massie situates Catherine's early life and three-decade reign as empress amidst the tumult of the European Enlightenment, enriching his own narrative with telling excerpts of her letters and rich discussions of her political environment and personal motivations.<br><br> Put simply, Massie is just the man to take this endlessly fascinating life and craft an utterly memorable book. <em>Catherine the Great: Portrait of a Woman</em> is a towering accomplishment, one of the year's best books in any genre. <em>--Jason Kirk</em></p> <p><b> Featured Images from <em>Catherine the Great</em></b></p> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> <br> The imperial coronation crown designed for Catherine.

In this classic volume, Graham offers a sensitive and comprehensive portrait of this much discussed but often misunderstood member of the Trinity.<p>(with Built-in Study Guide)</p></p><p><i>The Holy Spirit: Activating God's Power in Your Life</i> by Billy Graham begins with a very simple statement: "Man has two great spiritual needs. One is for forgiveness. The other is for goodness." Graham then affirms that "God heard that first cry for help, that cry for forgiveness, and answered it at Calvary" and that "God also heard our second cry ... and answered it at Pentecost." The Holy Spirit, Graham writes, is "the source of power who meets our need to escape from the miserable weakness that grips us," even after one has given one's life to Christ. "He gives us the power to be truly good." <p> In clear, concise prose, Graham then walks readers through biblical passages that teach about the Holy Spirit. He also describes some related concepts and experiences that are widely misunderstood, such as baptism with the spirit and sins against the Holy Spirit. And he gives readers a solid outline of the signs and fruits of the Spirit (such as love, joy, peace, patience, and kindness). Graham's book may be especially helpful for new Christians, but it will also serve as a helpful reminder to longtime believers. "No person can seek sincerely the cleansing and blessing of the Holy Spirit, and remain the same afterward," Graham promises. This promise is sufficiently grounded in scripture, and offered with such authoritative serenity that many readers will find real comfort here. <i>--Kevin Attwood</i></p>An informative, clarifying, and unifying book on the Holy Spirit <p>Who is the Holy Spirit and what does he do? The world-renowned evangelist Billy Graham offers a sensitive and comprehensive portrait of the much discussed but often-misunderstood member of the Trinity. The Holy Spirit came to empower God&#x2019;s people and transform their lives, yet so often the doctrine of the Holy Spirit causes division in the church. It is crucial to develop a genuinely biblical understand of the Third Person of the Trinity&#x2014;and to experience an authentic outpouring of his power.</p></p><h2>Corgiville Fair</h2><p>Chronicles the events of the Corgiville Fair, especially the foul play by Edgar Tomcat in his attempt to win the goat race.</p><p>Tasha Tudor is among the most prolific and revered illustrators of all time.

In <i>Unruly Waters</i>, historian Sunil Amrith reimagines Asia's history through the stories of its rains, rivers, coasts, and seas--and of the weather-watchers and engineers, mapmakers and farmers who have sought to control them. Looking out from India, he shows how dreams and fears of water shaped visions of political independence and economic development, provoked efforts to reshape nature through dams and pumps, and unleashed powerful tensions within and between nations.<br>Today, Asian nations are racing to construct hundreds of dams in the Himalayas, with dire environmental impacts; hundreds of millions crowd into coastal cities threatened by cyclones and storm surges.

Reissue.</p><p>4 1.5-hour cassettesReader Michael Prichard delivers a convincing rendition of Archie Goodwin, the burly right hand of the portly Nero Wolfe, world-renowned gourmand and detective. Prichard preserves the 1970s setting and 1950s origins of the story, bringing listeners a well-paced narration of murder and politics--a combination of elements that usually guarantees an exciting listen. This audio entertainment is as well formed and fragrant as one of Wolfe's hothouse orchids (the stout sleuth cultivates them by the hundreds in his town house greenhouse) as Goodwin walks us through an explosive murder investigation and political wheeling and dealing in a tough yet intelligent read.

Kathy and her husband, Paul, live in East Texas and have three grown children and five grandchildren. They enjoy world travel, deep sea fishing, and bird watching&#x2013;sometimes incorporating all three into one big adventure!The drone of deep voices in Jewel&#x2019;s Caf� turned to silence. Grayson Knolls lifted his gaze to the front door as Rue Kessler came inside and stomped the March snow off his boots.<br><br>Grayson fiddled with the bill of his cap and pasted on a bland expression. <i>Too bad you didn&#x2019;t get run over by a truck on the way over here. </i>He found the thought amusing.<br><br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s my future son-in-law.&#x201d; Elam Griffith pushed back his chair and stood, a broad smile appearing just below his mustache.<br><br>Rue did a double take and seemed surprised to see the EG Construction crew sitting around several tables that had been pushed together.<br><br>Grayson figured it was an act.<br><br>Elam shook Rue&#x2019;s hand and pulled him into a half bear hug. &#x201c;I lured you here under false pretenses. I just got through telling the crew that you&#x2019;ve agreed to be our project manager. It&#x2019;s official. Congratulations.&#x201d;<br><i><br>For what? Being handed a job he didn&#x2019;t earn? I&#x2019;m the one who deserves it.</i><br><br>The crew applauded, and then Joel Myers got up and shook Rue&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m looking forward to working with you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Thanks, same here,&#x201d; Rue said.<br><br>One by one the others got up and offered congratulations.<br><br>Grayson waited until last, then with his fabricated expression still intact, he stood and offered Rue a hearty handshake. &#x201c;Congratulations. Guess there <i>are</i> fringe benefits to marrying the boss&#x2019;s daughter.&#x201d;<br><br>Rue laughed. &#x201c;I never thought of it that way. You know she&#x2019;s my son&#x2019;s mother, and we&#x2019;re finally gonna be a family, right?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I heard.&#x201d;<br><br>Elam patted Rue on the back. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thrilled for Ivy. But I&#x2019;m excited about having someone in the family as passionate about this business as I am.&#x201d;<br><br>Grayson took his seat at the table, wrapped his hands around his mug, and imagined how good it would feel to slap the stupid grin off Kessler&#x2019;s face.<br><br>&#x201c;So when&#x2019;s the wedding?&#x201d; Joel asked. &#x201c;I assume my dad&#x2019;s going to perform the ceremony?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, Saturday morning, June 7. I told Pastor Myers that if I had my way, we&#x2019;d elope. But Ivy has her heart set on Woodlands Community Church.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So is your kid going to be in it?&#x201d; Grayson asked.<br><br>Rue nodded. &#x201c;Ring bearer. We&#x2019;re only having a best man and matron of honor stand up with us. The ceremony&#x2019;s gonna be simple.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But the reception <i>isn&#x2019;t</i>,&#x201d; Elam said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re having it out at our place, and Carolyn wants to do it up big. We only have one daughter and plan to marry her off in style. Rue, sit down. Have some coffee and decide what you want for breakfast. You&#x2019;re the man.&#x201d;<br><br>Still wearing that annoying toothy grin, Rue pulled out a chair across from Grayson. &#x201c;Life&#x2019;s pretty terrific right now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No kidding,&#x201d; Grayson said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got your entire future nailed down. Not bad for a guy who arrived here seven months ago&#x2013;fresh out of rehab on a temporary work program.&#x201d;<br><br>Grayson knew the instant he said it that he shouldn&#x2019;t have. Heat scalded his cheeks in the awkwardness that followed, and he took a sip of cold coffee, waiting for Rue to put him in his place.<br><br>&#x201c;I can hardly believe it myself.&#x201d; Rue&#x2019;s tone was surprisingly nondefensive. &#x201c;I just thank the Lord for it.&#x201d;<br><br>Elam&#x2019;s eyes narrowed as he homed in on Grayson. &#x201c;I asked Rue to manage the retirement village project because he has more experience than anyone here. But both of you are important players, and it&#x2019;s going to take you two working together to get the first phase done before September. Are we on the same page?&#x201d;<br><br>Grayson bobbed his head, hoping to move past the clumsiness of the moment. &#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t matter to me who I call boss as long as we get the work done right.&#x201d;<br><br>Jewel Sadler appeared at the table, her white hair flattened by a hairnet, a green pad in her hand. &#x201c;Are you fellas ready to order?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We all decided on the skillet scramble,&#x201d; Elam said. &#x201c;Rue, what about you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sounds great.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;All righty.&#x201d; Jewel winked at Rue and mouthed the word <i>congratulations</i>. &#x201c;Rita will bring you fruit muffins and a fresh coffee. We&#x2019;ll get your order out to you as fast as we can.&#x201d;<br><br>Grayson picked up the plastic carafe and emptied the last of the coffee into Rue&#x2019;s mug. &#x201c;So how long have you been in construction?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Since the day I got my first set of Tinker Toys. Actually, my granddad was a builder, and I worked for him every summer from middle school through college. In the twelve years since, I&#x2019;ve worked for several builders on a variety of projects, usually as foreman. I was supervisor on the last one.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised. I mean, considering your drinking problem and all.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fortunately, I was a functioning alcoholic&#x2013;till just before I entered rehab, anyway.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The point is: He kicked it,&#x201d; Elam said. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s move on.&#x201d;<br><br>Rue rubbed a coffee ring off the table with his index finger. &#x201c;If I were Grayson, I&#x2019;d probably wonder if you would&#x2019;ve hired an ex-drunk to manage this project if he wasn&#x2019;t about to become your son-in-law.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well, the nice thing about owning the company is I don&#x2019;t have to explain my decisions.&#x201d; Elam glanced across the table at Grayson. &#x201c;But in case anyone is wondering, I didn&#x2019;t just pin a title on Rue, I checked out his references. His work history&#x2019;s broad and impressive. He&#x2019;s an experienced foreman and supervisor, and he was being groomed for a management role on his last project. Plus he&#x2019;s got a bachelor&#x2019;s degree in construction management and civil engineering.&#x201d;<br><br>Elam patted Rue on the back. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s exactly what we need. This project is too involved for me to handle by myself, and having someone with his experience to juggle the details solves a big headache for me and for all of us. And it positions us to be on a fast track as soon as the weather warms up. Am I making myself clear?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Crystal clear,&#x201d; Grayson said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m one hundred percent onboard.&#x201d; <i>But what I plan to do when your back&#x2019;s turned is another story.<br></i><b><br></b>Rue Kessler gripped the wheel of his new Chevy Silverado and felt almost as if he were riding on air. Or was it just his mood? He spotted the entrance to Three Peaks Christian Camp and Conference Center and turned left just shy of it onto the private road that led to his in-laws&#x2019; log house.<br><br>He scanned the panorama of wide-open range and was awed by the brilliant kaleidoscope of wild flowers that had overtaken the valley floor. In the distance, the blue-gray peaks of the San Juan Mountains formed a backdrop worthy of a travel magazine. Rue let his mind wander, his heart basking in the pristine beauty.<br><br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s so funny?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Sorry, what?&#x201d; He turned to Ivy, her face radiant, her intriguing gray eyes animated and exuding joy. He mentally snapped a picture of her expression, determined to keep her that happy for the rest of his life. <br>&#x201c;You laughed out loud. I wondered what was so funny.&#x201d;<br><br>Rue picked up her hand and pressed it to his lips, a smile tugging at the corners of his mouth. &#x201c;I must be <i>really</i> happy because when we turned back there and started driving straight for those majestic peaks, I had this sudden urge to belt out the song from <i>The Sound of</i> <i>Music,</i> &#x2018;The hills are alive...with the sound of music...&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy laughed. &#x201c;Listen, mister. If you start singing like that when we get to Mom and Dad&#x2019;s, you&#x2019;re on your own.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I wonder what they expect me to say. I&#x2019;ve never brought someone&#x2019;s daughter home from her honeymoon before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I doubt they expect anything, other than to see us happy.&#x201d; Ivy craned her neck and peered out the front window. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m surprised Montana wasn&#x2019;t waiting for us when we made the turn. He sounded so excited on the phone.&#x201d;<br><br>Rue saw a glint of red on the split rail fence about a hundred yards up the road. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll bet that&#x2019;s him.&#x201d; He tooted the horn.<br><br>Montana jumped off the fence and waved his red cap in the air, then raced to the side of the road, flanked by two rollicking balls of fur.<br><br>Rue pulled over, and Ivy flung open the passenger door, slid out, and threw her arms around their son, the two huskies yelping and running in circles.<br><br>&#x201c;I thought you&#x2019;d never get here.&#x201d; Montana said, sounding out of breath. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been gone a really, really, <i>really</i> long time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s <i>so </i>good to see you.&#x201d; Ivy smothered him with kisses, then drew back and studied him. &#x201c;Oh, my. I think you&#x2019;ve grown in the past ten days.&#x201d;<br><br>Montana&#x2019;s mop of thick auburn hair fell in bangs just above his puppy eyes and shone like copper in the afternoon sun. &#x201c;Grandma says she&#x2019;s gonna put a brick on my head because I&#x2019;m growing too fast.&#x201d;<br><br>Rue got out and hurried around to the other sided of truck. He lifted Montana into his arms and whirled him around. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s my favorite son?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I beat Brandon at arm wrestling <i>two </i>times.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s awesome.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve been drinking lots and lots of milk and strawberry yogurt shakes&#x2013;the kind you said would make me strong.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, let&#x2019;s have a look.&#x201d; Rue set him on the ground.<br><br>Montana bent his arm and flexed his muscle.<br><br>&#x201c;Good grief. Are those <i>your</i> biceps? You&#x2019;re turning into the Hulk.&#x201d; Rue put his son in a headlock and tickled his chin, relishing the sound of his giggling. &#x201c;I missed you. You know that?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I missed you, too. So are you gonna sleep over now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely. My pajamas are right there in the suitcase. You&#x2019;re stuck with me for the rest of your life.&#x201d;<br>Montana&#x2019;s face beamed. &#x201c;Good. I always wanted to live with my dad since I was a little kid.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That long, eh?&#x201d; Rue winked at Ivy. &#x201c;How about we ride up the hill and say hi to Grandma and Grandpa? I&#x2019;m sure they&#x2019;re anxious to see us. Windy and Sasha can ride, too.&#x201d; He put the dogs in the bed of the truck and gave Montana a boost into the backseat.<br><br>&#x201c;Guess what?&#x201d; Montana buckled his seat belt. &#x201c;Uncle Rusty&#x2019;s moving here.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, sweetie. I doubt that,&#x201d; Ivy said.<br><br>&#x201c;Grandpa said so. The animal doctor died, and Uncle Rusty&#x2019;s gonna be it now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Doc Henley died?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uh-huh. He got a heart attack in his sleep.&#x201d;<br><br>Rue sensed Ivy tensing up and slid his arm around her slender waist. &#x201c;Well, your brother moving back to Jacob&#x2019;s Ear could be good news.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Uncle Rusty doesn&#x2019;t like me,&#x201d; Montana said. &#x201c;But Mom said it&#x2019;s <i>his </i>problem.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s right,&#x201d; Ivy said. &#x201c;It has nothing to do with you. Uncle Rusty is just mad at Mommy for some things that happened a long time ago when I was doing drugs. He&#x2019;s decided not to like me or anyone who&#x2019;s important to me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then he won&#x2019;t like Dad either.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be too sure about that,&#x201d; Rue said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m completely irresistible.&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy sighed, and he realized this wasn&#x2019;t the time to joke around.<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you worry about Rusty, babe. There&#x2019;s no way I&#x2019;m gonna let him mistreat you or Montana the way he did before. But he knows that moving back here means he&#x2019;ll be running into us. Maybe he&#x2019;s ready to mend fences.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Or he just wants to drive a wedge between us and Mom and Dad.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Rue pulled into the circle drive in front of Elam and Carolyn Griffith&#x2019;s log home, his mind flashing back to the huge white pavilion that had stood out front and the lavish luncheon reception that had been held there following the wedding. He turned to Ivy just as she turned to him, her face aglow. She squeezed his hand as if to say she was reminiscing, too.<br><br>Montana flung open the door and jumped out of the back and ran up the front steps, the dogs on his heels. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re here. They&#x2019;re here.&#x201d;<br><br>By the time Rue followed Ivy up to the porch, his in-laws and Montana had come outside, and in the next second, it was hard to tell who was hugging whom.<br><br>&#x201c;The two of you are positively radiant.&#x201d; Carolyn said.<br><br>Elam winked at Rue. &#x201c;Jamaica will do that to you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That must be it.&#x201d; Rue gave Ivy&#x2019;s hand a gentle squeeze. &#x201c;We can&#x2019;t thank you enough for such a great wedding trip.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Actually, for <i>everything,</i>&#x201d; Ivy said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve hardly stopped talking about the wedding and reception. Did any of the pictures turn out?&#x201d;<br><br>Elam chortled. &#x201c;Oh, just a couple hundred.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t have the professional proofs back yet,&#x201d; Carolyn said. &#x201c;But the digitals are really good. There&#x2019;s one in particular with Brandon and Kelsey that&#x2019;s priceless. I dare say your best man and matron of honor were almost as stunning as the two of you. Well, come in and have some blueberry cobbler and tell us all about Jamaica.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I want ice cream on mine.&#x201d; Montana disappeared through the front door.<br><br>&#x201c;Before we go in,&#x201d; Ivy said, &#x201c;what&#x2019;s this about Rusty moving back?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We were surprised, too.&#x201d; Elam put his arm around Carolyn&#x2019;s shoulder. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s already talked to Doc Henley&#x2019;s widow and made her an offer on the veterinary practice, and she accepted.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What about his practice in Albuquerque?&#x201d;<br><br>Elam shrugged. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t seem too concerned about leaving it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Has he sold his house?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, but he doesn&#x2019;t think it&#x2019;ll take long to sell it because of the upscale neighborhood and exceptional view. He&#x2019;s put down a deposit on a two-bedroom house in Jacob&#x2019;s Ear and plans to rent until he and Jacqueline find what they want. She and the girls will stay in Albuquerque until the house sells. He&#x2019;s planning to move in this weekend.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So much for Father&#x2019;s Day.&#x201d; Ivy&#x2019;s expression had lost the joy that bubbled over earlier. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t expect me to be happy about it. We all know Rusty lied about being sick so he wouldn&#x2019;t have to come to our wedding. It&#x2019;s obvious he wants nothing to do with us. And I don&#x2019;t want Montana put through the wringer again.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Hey...&#x201d; Rue tucked her hair behind her ear, unsettled by the apprehension in her eyes. &#x201c;I told you I&#x2019;m not gonna let him mistreat you two like he did before. But don&#x2019;t close your mind already. He might&#x2019;ve had a change of heart.&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy turned to her father. &#x201c;Do you think he did?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t had a chance to broach the subject with him yet,&#x201d; Elam said. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;m with Rue. We&#x2019;re not going to allow Rusty to treat you the way he did before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, I&#x2019;ll just be stuck with the guilt because the family&#x2019;s divided.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Baloney. We&#x2019;ve been divided on this issue since Rusty was here at Thanksgiving. It&#x2019;s not your fault that he chose to be difficult.&#x201d;<br><br>Ivy&#x2019;s sigh blew the bangs off her forehead. &#x201c;I know, Dad. But I&#x2019;m finally happy. The last thing I need is more of Rusty&#x2019;s venom.&#x201d;<br><br>The front door opened and Montana stood in the threshold, a much-too-angelic expression on his face. &#x201c;Hey, how come you guys are still out there when the blueberry cobbler is in here? Better hurry up before I eat it <i>all</i>.&#x201d; He laughed a husky laugh.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no, you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; Rue grabbed him and started tickling his ribs, evoking a loud squeal and a giggle.<br>Carolyn chuckled. &#x201c;All right, people. Sounds like we&#x2019;d better get in there and divide up the spoils.&#x201d;<br><br>***<br><br>Rue ate the last bite of his cobbler and pushed his bowl aside, eager to go home and get unpacked and start his new life with Ivy and Montana. He sat back in his chair, his hands folded across his middle. &#x201c;Carolyn, that&#x2019;s gotta be the best blueberry cobbler in the known world.&#x201d;<br><br>She smiled. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m glad you like it. Would you care for a little more?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My taste buds would, but my belt&#x2019;s telling me that two bowlfuls is enough.&#x201d;<br><br>Montana jum...</p><h2>Extreme Cities: The Peril and Promise of Urban Life in the Age of Climate Change</h2><p><b>A cutting exploration of how cities drive climate change while being on the frontlines of the coming climate crisis</b><br><br>How will climate change affect our lives? Where will its impacts be most deeply felt? Are we doing enough to protect ourselves from the coming chaos? In <i>Extreme Cities</i>, Ashley Dawson argues that cities are ground zero for climate change, contributing the lion&#x2019;s share of carbon to the atmosphere, while also lying on the frontlines of rising sea levels. Today, the majority of the world&#x2019;s megacities are located in coastal zones, yet few of them are adequately prepared for the floods that will increasingly menace their shores. Instead, most continue to develop luxury waterfront condos for the elite and industrial facilities for corporations. These not only intensify carbon emissions, but also place coastal residents at greater risk when water levels rise.<br><br> In <i>Extreme Cities</i>, Dawson offers an alarming portrait of the future of our cities, describing the efforts of Staten Island, New York, and Shishmareff, Alaska residents to relocate; Holland&#x2019;s models for defending against the seas; and the development of New York City before and after Hurricane Sandy. Our best hope lies not with fortified sea walls, he argues.

Crucial to his argument is the fact that technological solutions will not be enough, so that we need to drastically reform the capitalist economic system to properly price and value the biosphere and human lives.

Peary claimed discovery of the North Pole on April 6, 1909, the only other American to stand beside him was a black man, Matthew A. Henson. A native of Charles County, Maryland, Henson accompanied Peary on eight Arctic journeys between 1891 and 1909. His skill in interpreting the language of the North Greenland Eskimos, in building boats and repairing sledges, and in driving dog teams was essential to the ultimate success of the admiral, who wrote, "I can't get along without him." Yet Henson was for the most part ignored, even by Peary, after that historic expedition.&nbsp;<i>A Black Explorer at the North Pole</i> reminds the reader that where Peary went so did Henson&#x2014;often one step ahead as a troubleshooter. Drawing largely on his diaries, Henson describes the voyage of the steamer Roosevelt to Cape Sheridan on Ellesmere Island in the Canadian Arctic and the four-hundred-mile trek by dogsled over treacherous ice to the top of the world.&nbsp;Susan A. Kaplan, in her introduction to the Bison Book edition, discusses Henson&#x2019;s accomplishments and the current controversy surrounding Peary's claim to discovery of the North Pole.&nbsp;</p><p>Susan A.

It follows Bacon&#39;s early political career, which ended in scandal, and his subsequent scientific investigations; discusses his private life, including speculation on homosexual relationships with his servants; and claims that his death was caused by experimentation with opiates. The authors, both British scholars, have drawn on previously untapped archives for their research. Annotation c. Book News, Inc., Portland, OR (booknews.com)</p><p>For modern readers--especially those in the sciences who revere him as the father of the inductive method--Francis Bacon (1561-1626) is the model of an English Renaissance man whose towering intellectual achievements somewhat paradoxically set him floating above mundane historical particulars. British academics Lisa Jardine and Alan Stewart fling Bacon back into the hurly-burly of Elizabethan and Jacobean politics, where he unquestionably belongs. Indeed, their magnificently detailed rendering of Bacon's bumpy progression to the pinnacle of royal office-holding, as James I's lord chancellor (he was forced to "retire" in 1621 after a bribery scandal), makes his scientific and philosophical contributions even more remarkable. How on earth did he find time to write <i>The Advancement of Learning</i> (1605) and <i>Novum Organum</i> (1620) at all? In the authors' deliciously dense re-creation, notable for their shrewd evaluations of often misleading written source material, Bacon seems almost exclusively preoccupied with intriguing for promotion, struggling to pay debts incurred by his lavish lifestyle, and currying favor with both Elizabeth's and James's male favorites. (The latter tactic leading to contemporary charges of "sodomy" that the authors do not necessarily dismiss.) Some may regret that this warts-and-all portrait does not spend more time on Bacon's books, but Jardine and Stewart brilliantly succeed in their stated goal of providing "a rich context for those works." Seldom has a scholarly tome so palpably conveyed the gritty, sweaty, faction-ridden reality of being a working politician at the turn of the 17th century. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Lisa Jardine is the author of Worldly Goods: A New History of the Renaissance.

Over the long term, excessive amounts of this "primary stress hormone" can "kill your sex drive, shrink your brain, squelch your immune system, and generally make you feel terrible." While Talbott freely admits that nearly as many ways to cope with stress exist as events and situations that cause it, his recommended solution to alleviating tension and achieving balanced cortisol levels is the SENSE program. These five principles-Stress management, Exercise, Nutrition, Supplements and Evaluation-aren't necessarily groundbreaking, but they're undoubtedly sensible. Talbott is a nutritionist, and thus the book's coverage of vitamins, minerals and adaptogens (general anti-stress supplements) is especially comprehensive, and includes important recommendations for safety and dosage levels. With features including a "Stress Self-Test," daily food plans and a guide to additional stress management resources, the text is organized for both quick reference use as well as for readers, especially health care workers, interested in conducting a more detailed exploration. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Jewish Alchemists (Princeton Legacy Library, 236)</h2><p><p>In this monumental work, Raphael Patai opens up an entirely new field of cultural history by tracing Jewish alchemy from antiquity to the nineteenth century. Until now there has been little attention given to the significant role that Jews played in the field of alchemy. Here, drawing on an enormous range of previously unexplored sources, Patai reveals that Jews were major players in what was for centuries one of humanity's most compelling intellectual obsessions.</p><p>Originally published in 1994.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press. These editions preserve the original texts of these important books while presenting them in durable paperback and hardcover editions. The goal of the Princeton Legacy Library is to vastly increase access to the rich scholarly heritage found in the thousands of books published by Princeton University Press since its founding in 1905.</p></p><p>Raphael Patai has taught at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Princeton University, Columbia University, and the University of Pennsylvania.A long and quirky look at 1,800 years of minimal Jewish involvement with a pseudoscience, adding little of use either to Jewish history or to the history of science. As he did with The Hebrew Goddess (not reviewed), Patai offers an oxymoronic title and a strained thesis: in this case, that Jews played a major role in the pursuit of the chimerical science of alchemy. While he admits that a only tiny minority of alchemists were Jews, Patai goes on to suggest--but never to prove--that ``the [Jewish] people at large may have believed in the reality of alchemy.'' He dredges up the belief of Hellenist and Muslim adepts of the early Middle Ages that biblical figures were alchemists. Such claims regarding the patriarch Jacob, for example, merely rest on his longevity (a prime alchemical goal) and the mention of a stone on which he props his head (inexplicably associated with the philosopher's stone). With an assortment of obscure charts, tables, and doctrines, the book moves from centuries of Hellenist and Muslim domination of alchemy (with only a Jew or two on the periphery) to 14th-century European Christendom. Apparently the only legitimate reason to connect Judaism to alchemy is that a few curious Jews recorded the ``science'' of their time in Hebrew and ``saved originally non-Jewish alchemical writing for posterity.'' Instead of attempting to establish a link between alchemy and Judaism, Patai might have explored centuries of Christendom's superstitious association of Jews with magical, esoteric, and dark arts. Moreover, he doesn't back up his claim that medieval alchemists were ``the forerunners of modern chemistry,'' so we can't even salvage something for the history of science from this wasteland of bizarre and rather useless information. The real alchemy here is the magical way academics can turn a simple thesis into a 587-page book and a gold mine of research grants. -- <i>Copyright �1994, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But Pears has set himself an additional challenge by spreading his narrators over several centuries: there's the fifth century French nobleman and bishop, Manlius, a civilized man who has embraced the uncouth Christian faith in order to protect what he holds dear; an 11th-century scholar and troubadour named Olivier de Noyen, the famously ill-fated admirer of a married girl; and Julien Barneuve, an early 20th-century scholar of de Noyen who discovers, through him, a magnificent manuscript of Manlius's called "The Dream of Scipio." Though all three men come from the same small Proven�al town, it is this manuscript, derived from the teachings of a wise woman, that links the three narrative threads of Pears's story. At the heart of <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> and, one suspects, at the heart of its author, is the conflict between a classical ideal of learning and the contemplation of beauty, and the noisy, uncivilized, democratizing impulses of the Christian era. A novel of ideas like its predecessor, <i>The Dream of Scipio</i> is neither chilly nor didactic and doesn't shy away from depicting the costs of its narrators' unpopular devotions. <i>--Regina Marler</i>"Iain Pears aims high in his novels. <b>The Dream of Scipio</b> (Knopf), his latest, encompasses three narratives set hundreds of years apart in the same tiny corner of Provence, all three variations on a theme -- what is a civilized man to do when the barbarians are at the gate? And Pears pulls it off in a virtuoso display of craftsmanship that brings the stories, at the same rapidly building pace, to their very different, but subtly linked, conclusions." -- <i>Maclean&#x2019;s</i> <br> <b><i><br></i></b>"A dazzling triptych of love and ideas&#x2026;. Pears's finest book yet, even more successful and riveting than its predecessor&#x2026;.. [I]mmensely readable, fast-moving, and full of wonderful juxtapositions&#x2026;. Take a chance on this odd book. Youll be very glad you did." -- <i>Boston Globe</i> <b><br></b> <br>"Pears' elaborate narrative triptych is dazzling for its structure, its complexity, and the richness of thought that gives it texture. But, finally, it is the passion of the love stories, undercutting bloodless philosophy while embracing the messiness of life, that lets the novel soar." -- <i>Booklist </i>(starred review) <br> <br>" <b>The Dream of Scipio</b> is complex, surprising and thought-provoking, a dream of a novel in more senses than one. " -- <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> <br> <br>"English writer Iain Pears possesses that wildly rare quality displayed only by writers like A.S. Byatt in <b>Possession</b> or Umberto Eco in <b>The Name of the Rose</b>: the ability to be both extraordinarily erudite and thoroughly capable of writing a novel that the intellectually unwashed can enjoy&#x2026;. <b> </b>Pears makes you think and want to learn more. This is not escapist literature but educational in the very best sense of the word&#x2026;. Pears has the ability to create characters who are immediately recognizable&#x2026;. this novel is worth your time." -- <i>USA Today<br></i> <b><br></b>&#x201c;If the highest test of a work of imaginative literature is whether it can make you think and feel at the same time, this novel passes it&#x2026;If a better novel is published this year and carries off the Booker and other prizes, I shall be amazed.&#x201d; -- <i>The Scotsman<br></i> <br>&#x201c;It is difficult to know where to begin in praising the achievement of this rigorous but infinitely beguiling book. The novel of ideas has been moribund for quite some time, but Pears breathes rude life into the genre with an epic that echoes the achievements of Robert Graves and Andr� Gide. The balance between the key questions of existence and the passionate, life-affirming solidity that the author grants to his characters is impeccable, and all three protagonists are forcefully characterised&#x2026;But above all, this is a piece of storytelling that almost redefines the very notion of the art: luminescent entertainment by a master, even more impressive than <b>An Instance of the Fingerpost</b>, the book which first drew attention to Pears&#x2019; highly individual skills.&#x201d; -- Amazon.co.uk <br> <br>"Combining the visceral pleasures of a thriller with the more intellectual excitements of a novel of ideas ....beautifully constructed and, for such a cerebrally challenging book, remarkably easy to read." -- <i>The Telegraph</i> (London) <br> <br> <b>Praise for An Instance of the Fingerpost</b> <br>&#x201c;Every sentence in the book is as solid as a brick -- and as treacherous as quicksand&#x2026; Iain Pears has written an impressively original and audaciously imaginative intellectual thriller.&#x201d; -- <i>The Washington Post Book World</i></p><h2>The Best Recipes from New England Inns: More Than 100 Country Inns Share Their Traditional Favorites and Specialties of the House</h2><p>The best recipes from New England inns: More than 100 country inns share their traditional favorites and specialties of the house [Jan 01, 1984] Taylor, Sandra</p><p></p><h2>Let Me Take You Down: Inside the Mind of Mark David Chapman, the Man Who Killed John Lennon</h2><p>A journalist goes inside the mind of a killer in a portrait of Mark David Chapman--drawn from interviews with Chapman, his family, and friends--that reveals a man driven to murder in a fruitless, obsessive quest for identity. 60,000 first printing. $60,000 ad/promo.</p><p><b>Jack Jones</b>, recipient of numerous journalist awards, conducted the first prison interviews with David Berkowitz, the Son of Sam.From the title's tasteless allusion to the Lennon song "Strawberry Fields Forever" to the excusing treatment of a psychopath, this sensationalistic biography proves repugnant. Jones, noted for being the first reporter to interview "Son of Sam" killer David Berkowitz, describes the personality of Mark David Chapman before and after he shot and killed former Beatle John Lennon on Dec. 8, 1980, in New York City. We learn of Chapman's fascination with The Catcher in the Rye protagonist Holden Caulfield; we hear the voices of the evil "child" and rational "adult" arguing within Chapman as he stalked Lennon; we read of Chapman's "possession by demons" after his imprisonment. Jones's introduction claims "Chapman asked the author to undertake the telling of his story in the hope that it might prevent future tragedy." Shamefully, however, this book serves only the ignoble purpose of promoting a criminal's narcissism.

Ernst visited Escher every week for a year, systematically talking through his entire &#x153;uvre with him.

Can we look into the make-up of the universe and apply it to who we are and what we do? The answers to these questions are to be found in the new science of socionomics. <p>Socionomics evolved from the Wave Principle, a theory of patterns in financial markets. Now Robert Prechter proposes that this very same principle can be applied to our own social and cultural lives. Prechter shows that dominant aspects of our unconscious mentation are characterized by measurable patterns. Those patterns form the building blocks of humankind's social interaction, and in turn, the Wave Principle. </p><p>"WOW stuff! Prechter is doing the most creative work that I have seen in my career on Wall Street." &#x2013;John R. Greeley, professional market analyst, co-founder, Market Technicians Association "Spectacular. I was absolutely impressed. A most brilliant work." &#x2013;David Johnson, PhD, MD </p><p>"Congratulations to Robert Prechter for his interesting, insightful and trail-blazing work. Anyone willing to take the time to read this volume will be rewarded with a new understanding of human behavior, markets and events." &#x2013;Tom Spradley, retired college mathematics professor </p><p>"Learning about socionomics has proven to be one of those rare intellectual epiphanies that results in an absolute change in the direction of my life. So much about the human experience that had mystified me all of my adult life seems so clear now, so understandable &#x2013; even to the point of being predictable." &#x2013;Jack Hobson-Dupont, President, Monadyne Corp. </p><p>"I love this theory. Socionomics is sure to be a primary reference source for quite some time. The volume and value of analysis that Prechter has conducted is something hard to over-appreciate. There should be university courses and degrees in the science of socionomics and perhaps Nobel Prize winners as well. I recommend many readings of the book to appreciate it in depth." Professor Valeri Safonov, PhD, former First Secretary of Ministry of External Affairs of USSR and economist with the Russian Embassies in Canada and India</p></p><p>Comments from the Author: Robert R. Prechter, Jr. <p>The social sciences today are where the physical sciences were three hundred years ago: on the verge of a revolution. Ralph Nelson Elliott discovered that social mood, impelled by an unconscious herding impulse, fluctuates in a recognizable pattern reflecting a natural growth principle, which he called the Wave Principle. Socionomics is the study of these patterns and their effects, i.e., social action and the events of history. Because it has a mathematical base, the Wave Principle is to sociology what Newton&#x2019;s laws were to physics. It provides a basis and framework within which to study and quantify social behavior and thus serves as an anchor for the undertaking of true social science.</p>Author Bio: Robert R. Prechter, Jr. <p>Robert R. Prechter, Jr. has achieved worldwide fame as an author, investment analyst, businessman and social commentator. In 1978, he co-authored with A.J. Frost Elliott Wave Principle: Key to Market Behavior. The book sold more than 300,000 copies and became a Wall Street Best Seller. Three other books have followed, all of them achieving similar success. In addition to his books, he is the editor of the Elliott Wave Theorist, an award-winning newsletter that has enjoyed immense popularity in its 20 years of publication. In 1984, Prechter disproved any doubters that the Elliott Wave Principle was a window to financial opportunity when he set an all-time record in the United States Trading Championship. Using the Wave Principle as his only method of analysis, he returned 444.4% in a monitored, real-money options account in the four-month contest period. His success did not go unnoticed, and in December 1989, Financial News Network named him, &#x201c;Guru of the Decade.&#x201d; A flood of radio, television, and written interviews followed, including the cover of Time Magazine and Fortune. On the heels of this success, he founded Elliott Wave International, a successful technical investment analysis company located near Atlanta, Ga. Now, after years researching and studying the psychology and science behind the Wave Principle, Prechter delves deeper than ever before into the reasons for its existence and its universal implications. In his most recent book, The Wave Principle of Human Social Behavior he formulates his theories into a new branch of science he calls &#x201c;socionomics.&#x201d; The book is being hailed as a tremendous success by both general readers and academic scholars.</p></p><h2>Ripper: A Novel</h2><p><p>Isabel Allende&#x2014;the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author whose books, including <em>Maya&#x2019;s Notebook, Island Beneath the Sea</em>, and <em>Zorro</em>, have sold more than 57 million copies around the world&#x2014;demonstrates her remarkable literary versatility with <em>Ripper</em>, an atmospheric, fast-paced mystery involving a brilliant teenage sleuth who must unmask a serial killer in San Francisco.</p><p>The Jackson women, Indiana and Amanda, have always had each other.

Discover how they spend their days, what they eat, where and when they sleep, and how they protect themselves. There are also tips on having a pill bug come to stay at your house...but only for a while!</p><p>Yukihisa Tokuda was born in Japan in 1940 and has always been enchanted by insects. He began creating insect picure books while still a student at university. Kiyoshi Takahashi was working as an oil painter when he began to crete picture books about insects and plants with the detailed and real life drawings for which he is widley known.*Starred Review* PreS-Gr. 2. Many children know pill bugs as roly-polies and think of them as insects. In this picture book, a pill bug narrates a fascinating account of life among his humble yet admirable fellow crustaceans. In an easy-to-follow, conversational style, he explains what pill bugs eat and excrete, why they live near people, how they protect themselves against predators, why they shed and then eat their shells ("Yum! Very nutritious"), how they reproduce, and more. The final pages describe how to find pill bugs, touch them, and even keep one indoors as a guest before putting it back, since "He'll want to be with his family during the cold winter!" The lucid, matter-of-fact text answers the main questions children may have about the critters as well as some they might not have thought to ask. Meanwhile, handsome cut-paper collages re-create the pill bugs' world in realistic yet simplified terms. One series of pictures shows what happens when a pill bug encounters an ant, allowing even nonreaders to "read" what happens: the pill bug curls into a hard ball to ward off the ant's attack. Like others in the Nature: A Child's Eye View series, this excellent science picture book was originally published in Japan. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I'm going to lose. My battle is as futile as a woman feeling the first pangs of labor and deciding it's an inconvenient time to give birth. Nature wins out. It always does.<br><br>It's nearly two a.m., too late for this foolishness and I need my sleep. Four nights spent cramming to meet a deadline have left me exhausted. It doesn't matter. Patches of skin behind my knees and elbows have been tingling and now begin to burn. My heart beats so fast I have to gulp air. I clench my eyes shut, willing the sensations to stop but they don't.<br><br>Philip is sleeping beside me. He's another reason why I shouldn't leave, sneaking out in the middle of the night again and returning with a torrent of lame excuses. He's working late tomorrow. If I can just wait one more day. My temples begin to throb. The burning sensation in my skin spreads down my arms and legs. The rage forms a tight ball in my gut and threatens to explode.<br><br>I've got to get out of here-I don't have a lot of time left.<br><br>Philip doesn't stir when I slip from the bed. There's a pile of clothing tucked underneath my dresser so I won't risk the squeaks and groans of opening drawers and closets. I pick up my keys, clasping my fist around them so they don't jangle, ease open the door, and creep into the hallway.<br><br>Everything's quiet. The lights seem dimmed, as if overpowered by the emptiness. When I push the elevator button, it creaks out a complaint at being disturbed at so ungodly an hour. The first floor and lobby are equally empty. People who can afford the rent this close to downtown Toronto are comfortably asleep by this time.<br><br>My legs itch as well as hurt and I curl my toes to see if the itching stops. It doesn't. I look down at the car keys in my hand. It's too late to drive to a safe place-the itching has crystallized into a sharp burn. Keys in my pocket, I stride onto the streets, looking for a quiet place to Change. As I walk, I monitor the sensation in my legs, tracing its passage to my arms and the back of my neck. Soon. Soon. When my scalp starts to tingle, I know I have walked as far as I can so I search for an alley. The first one I find has been claimed by two men squeezed together inside a tattered big-screen TV box. The next alley is empty. I hurry to the end and undress quickly behind a barricade of trash bins, hide the clothes under an old newspaper. Then I start the Change.<br><br>My skin stretches. The sensation deepens and I try to block the pain. Pain. What a trivial word-agony is better. One doesn't call the sensation of being flayed alive "painful." I inhale deeply and focus my attention on the Change, dropping to the ground before I'm doubled over and forced down. It's never easy-perhaps I'm still too human. In the struggle to keep my thoughts straight, I try to anticipate each phase and move my body into position-head down, on all fours, arms and legs straight, feet and hands flexed, and back arched. My leg muscles knot and convulse. I gasp and strain to relax. Sweat breaks out, pouring off me in streams, but the muscles finally relent and untwist themselves. Next comes the ten seconds of hell that used to make me swear I'd rather die than endure this again. Then it's over.<br><br>Changed.<br><br>I stretch and blink. When I look around, the world has mutated to an array of colors unknown to the human eye, blacks and browns and grays with subtle shadings that my brain still converts to blues and greens and reds. I lift my nose and inhale. With the Change, my already keen senses sharpen even more. I pick up scents of fresh asphalt and rotting tomatoes and window-pot mums and day-old sweat and a million other things, mixing together in an odor so overwhelming I cough and shake my head. As I turn, I catch distorted fragments of my reflection in a dented trash can. My eyes stare back at me. I curl my lips back and snarl at myself. White fangs flash in the metal.<br><br>I am a wolf, a 130-pound wolf with pale blond fur. The only part of me that remains are my eyes, sparking with a cold intelligence and a simmering ferocity that could never be mistaken for anything but human.<br><br>I look around, inhaling the scents of the city again. I'm nervous here. It's too close, too confined; it reeks of human spoor. I must be careful. If I'm seen, I'll be mistaken for a dog, a large mixed breed, perhaps a husky and yellow Labrador mix. But even a dog my size is cause for alarm when it's running loose. I head for the back of the laneway and seek a path through the underbelly of the city.<br><br>My brain is dulled, disoriented not by my change of form but by the unnaturalness of my surroundings. I can't get my bearings and the first alley I go down turns out to be the one I'd encountered in human form, the one with the two men in the faded Sony box. One of them is awake now. He's tugging the remnants of a filth-encrusted blanket between his fingers as if he can stretch it large enough to cover himself against the cold October night. He looks up and sees me. His eyes widen. He starts to shrink back, then stops himself. He says something. His voice is crooning, the musical, exaggerated tones people use with infants and animals. If I concentrated, I could make out the words, but there's no point. I know what he's saying, some variation of "nice doggy," repeated over and over in a variety of inflections. His hands are outstretched, palms out to ward me off, the physical language contradicting the vocal. Stay back-nice doggy-stay back. And people wonder why animals don't understand them.<br><br>I can smell the neglect and waste rising from his body. It smells like weakness, like an aged deer driven to the fringe of the herd, prime pickings for predators. If I were hungry, he'd smell like dinner. Fortunately, I'm not hungry yet, so I don't have to deal with the temptation, the conflict, the revulsion. I snort, condensation trumpeting from my nostrils, then turn and lope back up the alley.<br><br>Ahead is a Vietnamese restaurant. The smell of food is embedded in the very wood frame of the building. On a rear addition, an exhaust fan turns slowly, clicking with each revolution as one blade catches the metal screen casing. Below the fan a window is open. Faded sunflower-print curtains billow out in the night breeze. I can hear people inside, a room full of people, grunting and whistling in sleep. I want to see them. I want to stick my muzzle in the open window and look inside. A werewolf can have a lot of fun with a roomful of unprotected people.<br><br>I start to creep forward but a sudden crackle and hiss stops me. The hiss softens, then is drowned out by a man's voice, sharp, his words snapped off like icicles. I turn my head each way, radar searching for the source. He's farther down the street. I abandon the restaurant and go to him. We are curious by nature.<br><br>He's standing in a three-car parking lot wedged at the end of a narrow passage between buildings. He holds a walkie-talkie to his ear and leans one elbow against a brick wall, casual but not resting. His shoulders are relaxed. His gaze goes nowhere. He is confident in his place, that he has a right to be here and little to fear from the night. The gun dangling from his belt probably helps. He stops talking, jabs a button, and slams the walkie-talkie into its holster. His eyes scan the parking lot once, taking inventory and seeing nothing requiring his attention. Then he heads deeper into the alley maze. This could be amusing. I follow.<br><br>My nails click against the pavement. He doesn't notice. I pick up speed, darting around trash bags and empty boxes. Finally, I'm close enough. He hears the steady clicking behind him and stops. I duck behind a Dumpster, peer around the corner. He turns and squints into the darkness. After a second he starts forward. I let him get a few steps away, then resume the pursuit. This time when he stops, I wait one extra second before diving for cover. He lets out a muffled oath. He's seen something-a flash of motion, a shadow flickering, something. His right hand slips to his gun, caressing the metal, then pulling back, as if the reassurance is enough. He hesitates, then looks up and down the alley, realizing he is alone and uncertain what to do about it. He mutters something, then continues walking, quicker this time.<br><br>As he walks, his eyes flick from side to side, wariness treading the border of alarm. I inhale deeply, picking up only wisps of fear, enough to make my heart pound, but not enough to send my brain spinning out of control. He's safe quarry for a stalking game. He won't run. I can suppress most of my instincts. I can stalk him without killing him. I can suffer the first pangs of hunger without killing him. I can watch him pull his gun without killing him. Yet if he runs, I won't be able to stop myself. That's a temptation I can't fight. If he runs, I will chase. If I chase, either he'll kill me or I'll kill him.<br><br>As he turns the corner down a connecting alley, he relaxes. All has been silent behind him. I creep from my hiding place, shifting my weight to the back of my foot pads to muffle the sound of my nails. Soon I am only a few feet behind him. I can smell his aftershave, almost masking the natural scent of a long day's work. I can see his white socks appearing and disappearing between his shoes and pant legs. I can hear his breathing, the slight elevation in tempo betraying the fact that he's walking faster than usual. I ease forward, coming close enough that I could lunge if I want to and knock him to the ground before he even thought to reach for his gun. His head jerks up. He knows I'm there. He knows something is there. I wonder if he will turn. Does he dare to look, to face something he can't see or hear, but can only sense? His hand slides to his gun, but he doesn't turn. He walks faster. Then he swings back to the safety of the street.<br><br>I follow him to the end and observe from the darkness. He strides forward, keys in hand, to a parked cruiser, unlocks it, and hops inside. The car roars and squeals from the curb. I watch the receding taillights and sigh. Game over. I won.<br><br>That was nice but it wasn't nearly enough to satisfy me. These city backstreets are too confining. My heart is thudding with unspent excitement. My legs are aching with built-up energy. I must run.<br><br>A wind gusts from the south, bringing the sharp tang of Lake Ontario with it. I think of heading to the beach, imagine running along the stretch of sand, feeling the icy water slapping against my paws, but it's not safe. If I want to run, I must go to the ravine. It's a long way, but I have little choice unless I plan to skulk around human-smelling alleyways for the rest of the night. I swing to the northwest and begin the journey.<br><br>Nearly a half hour later, I'm standing at the crest of a hill. My nose twitches, picking up the vestiges of an illegal leaf fire smoldering in a nearby yard. The wind bristles through my fur, chill, nearly cold, invigorating. Above me, traffic thunders across the overpass. Below is sanctuary, a perfect oasis in the middle of the city. I leap forward, throwing myself off. At last I'm running. <br>My legs pick up the rhythm before I'm halfway down the ravine. I close my eyes for a second and feel the wind slice across my muzzle. As my paws thump against the hard earth, tiny darts of pain shoot up my legs, but they make me feel alive, like jolting awake after an overlong sleep. The muscles contract and extend in perfect harmony. With each stretch comes an ache and a burst of physical joy. My body is thanking me for the exercise, rewarding me with jolts of near-narcotic adrenaline. The more I run, the lighter I feel, the pain falling free as if my paws are no longer striking the ground. Even as I race along the bottom of the ravine, I feel like I'm still running downhill, gaining energy instead of expending it. I want to run until all the tension in my body flies away, leaving nothing but the sensations of the moment. I couldn't stop if I wanted to. And I don't want to.<br><br>Dead leaves crackle under my paws. Somewhere in the forest an owl hoots softly. It has finished its hunting and rests contented, not caring who knows it's around. A rabbit bolts out of a thicket and halfway across my path, then realizes its mistake and zooms back into the undergrowth. I keep running. My heart pounds. Against my rising body heat, the air feels ice-cold, stinging as it storms through my nostrils and into my lungs. I inhale, savoring the shock of it hitting my insides. I'm running too fast to smell anything. Bits of scents flutter through my brain in a jumbled montage that smells of freedom. Unable to resist, I finally skid to a halt, throw my head back, and howl. The music pours up from my chest in a tangible evocation of pure joy. It echoes through the ravine and soars to the moonless sky, letting them all know I'm here. I own this place! When I'm done, I drop my head, panting with exertion. I'm standing there, staring down into a scattering of yellow and red maple leaves, when a sound pierces my self-absorption. It's a growl, a soft, menacing growl. There's a pretender to my throne.<br><br>I look up to see a brownish yellow dog standing a few meters away. No, not a dog. My brain takes a second, but it finally recognizes the animal. A coyote. The recognition takes a second because it's unexpected. I've heard there are coyotes in the city, but have never encountered one. The coyote is equally confused. Animals don't know what to make of me. They smell human, but see wolf and, just when they decide their nose is tricking them, they look into my eyes and see human. When I encounter dogs, they either attack or turn tail and run. The coyote does neither. It lifts its muzzle and sniffs the air, then bristles and pulls its lips back in a drawn-out growl. It's half my size, scarcely worth my notice. I let it know this with a lazy "get lost" growl and a shake of my head. The coyote doesn't move. I stare at it. The coyote breaks the gaze-lock first.<br><br>I snort, toss my head again, and slowly turn away. I'm halfway turned when a flash of brown fur leaps at my shoulder. Diving to the side, I roll out of the way, then scramble to my feet. The coyote snarls. I give a serious growl, a canine "now you're pissing me off." The coyote stands its ground. It wants a fight. Good.<br><br>My fur rises on end, my tail bushing out behind me. I lower my head between my shoulder bones and lay my ears flat. My lips pull back and I feel the snarl tickling up through my throat then reverberating into the night. The coyote doesn't back down. I crouch and I'm about to lunge when something hits me hard in the shoulder, throwing me off balance. I stumble, then twist to face my attacker. A second coyote, gray-brown, hangs from my shoulder, fangs sunk to the bone. With a roar of rage and pain, I buck up and throw my weight to the side. <br><br>As the second coyote flies free, the first launches itself at my face. Ducking my head, I catch it in the throat, but my teeth clamp down on fur instead of flesh and it squirms away. It tries to back off for a second lunge, but I leap at it, backing it into a tree. It rears up, trying to get out of my way. I slash for its throat. This time I get my grip. Blood spurts in my mouth, salty and thick. The coyote's mate lands on my back. My legs buckle. Teeth sink into the loose skin beneath my skull. Fresh pain arcs through me. Concentrating hard, I keep my grip on the first coyote's throat. I steady myself, then release it for a split second, just long enough to make the fatal slash and tear. As I pull back, blood sprays into my eyes, blinding me. I swing my head hard, ripping out the coyote's throat. Once I feel it go limp, I toss it aside, then throw myself on the ground and roll over. The coyote on my back yips in surprise ...</p><h2>The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes: The Peerless Peer</h2><p>Holmes and Watson take to the skies in the quest of the nefarious Von Bork and his weapon of dread...

Except for Jesus, more miracles are attributed to him than to anyone else in Scripture. Was this so Elisha could serve as God's example of a great man? Was it to prove that&nbsp;Israel's God was greater than the pagan gods and goddesses of Canaan? Or did each of Elisha's miracles represent a breakthrough, a moment in time, when God reached out of the unseen realm of eternity and into time? Yes. Yes. And yes. But that's not all.</p> <p>Doing God's work requires faith--the ability to see the dimension of life that lies beyond our sight. Elisha saw this. We can, too.</p> <p>To aid us, David Roper uses Elisha's miracles as "little pictures of God"--as windows to another dimension to help us see God as He really is. These "pictures" also remind us that God's help is always available to those who ask, and that God's most effective servants bring the needy to God so that He can minister to them.</p> <p>Spiritual awareness is seeing everything through God's eyes, hearing with His ears, responding to others with His love. David Roper challenges us to study God's Word and to "grow eyes". Then he uses the grid of Elisha's life to show us how.</p> <p>WHAT READERS ARE SAYING ABOUT THE WORKS OF DAVID ROPER: "Really appreciate his work and find much comfort in it." ...

IT streamed down his forehead, collected in his eyebrows, and dripped from the end of his nose. Every few minutes he stopped digging and wiped his brow with the back of his hand. It did not do much good. Seconds later, the perspiration was flowing as freely as before.A few miles away, in Lynchburg, the weather bureau&#x2019;s protected thermometer was pushing eighty-four. But it was hotter than that in the shadeless garden where Derek and his wife, Nancy, had been working since early that morning. It was much too hot, Derek thought, for March 30. Without turning his head, he asked his wife, &#x201c;How are you holding up?&#x201d;&#x201c;As far as I&#x2019;m concerned, we can call it a day,&#x201d; Nancy replied wearily.&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a good idea,&#x201d; Derek agreed, slowly straightening his stiffening back. &#x201c;I think it&#x2019;s sundowner time.&#x201d;Normally, it does not get particularly warm in the Blue Ridge Mountain country of central Virginia until much later in the year. But 1985 was an exception; the sun had been beating down relentlessly all week. It was particularly hard on Derek, who was accustomed to cooler climes.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be just as miserable tomorrow as it was today,&#x201d; he grumbled as he gathered his tools and began stacking them at the side of the house. Sometimes he was as fussy as an old maid, which is about what one might expect from a man whose favorite hobby, after gardening and card games, was designing circuit boards for ham radios. &#x201c;But that doesn&#x2019;t matter,&#x201d; he panted. &#x201c;Palm Sunday or no, we&#x2019;re going to have to be out early again.&#x201d;Nancy nodded silently in agreement, too exhausted to reply. Turning toward the house, she listlessly peeled off her thick cotton gloves and threw them on the ground.As he gathered the equipment, Derek tried to make light of his fatigue, joking about his &#x201c;seventy-two-year-old bones&#x201d; and how it was getting harder to bounce back than it used to be. Advancing age was not something he accepted readily. To help postpone it, he kept in shape with tennis and sporadic jogs along Holcomb Rock Road, the narrow, twisting thoroughfare that ran in front of their house. But a long day of hard labor in a hot sun was enough to drain even the barrel-chested Derek.The Haysoms had moved to Boonsboro three years before, in 1982, after Derek retired as director of a venture capital organization in Nova Scotia. An engineer by education and training, Derek had shifted into management at midcareer and worked in executive jobs on three continents. Boonsboro beckoned because it was a suburb of Lynchburg, where Nancy had grown up. They lived in relative tranquility in a modest two-story house that Nancy had named Loose Chippings, after a dwelling in an obscure British novel. In the novel, the house was called that because it served as a sort of way station for eccentrics. Nancy found that particularly applicable to their situation.Naming houses was one of Nancy&#x2019;s little quirks. Another was collecting small boulders, which she used for building walls around the gardens they always planted whenever they moved to a new residence. Over the twenty-five years she and Derek had been married, wherever they lived, Nancy always built rock walls around their gardens. Now that she was into middle age, the children nagged her about it. Wrestling with outsized rocks, they argued, was not a hobby particularly conducive to her continued good health. To appease them, she promised that the wall at Loose Chippings would be her last.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m for a shower,&#x201d; she said, running her hand through a mop of auburn hair that was just beginning to show streaks of gray.&#x201c;You go ahead,&#x201d; Derek muttered. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll finish up here and then I&#x2019;ll be right behind you.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&#x201c;GOD, IT WAS BEASTLY OUT TODAY,&#x201d; NANCY SAID, LOOKING cool and comfortable in a royal blue dashiki she had chosen for a quiet evening at home. Her speech was clipped and sprinkled with Briticisms, which was not surprising considering she had spent the last thirty-six years, since she was seventeen, living among British expatriates in southern Africa and Canada. Despite her Virginia roots, there was hardly a hint of a southern drawl.&#x201c;Summer will be here before we know it,&#x201d; agreed Derek. &#x201c;At times like this I wish we were back in Nova Scotia.&#x201d;While Nancy&#x2019;s accent was affected, Derek&#x2019;s was legitimate. Most Americans hearing him talk, in fact, thought he was British. In reality, he was a South African of British descent, a native of Natal Province on the East Coast. During the years he worked and studied in the United Kingdom before returning to southern Africa after World War II, he polished his speech to the point where no one but an Englishman would notice his colonial roots.Nancy sighed. Finishing her drink, she extended her empty glass. &#x201c;Would you, please?&#x201d; she asked Derek.Derek took it and strode to the liquor cabinet. &#x201c;The same?&#x201d; he asked, already pouring a large shot of gin over the melting cubes.She did not answer. Given a choice, Nancy almost always drank gin: Boodles when it was available, Gordon&#x2019;s when it was not. It was a sign of his exhaustion that Derek did not offer his usual lecture on the evils of her beverage of choice. Almost invariably he chided her about her love for gin. &#x201c;The juniper extract used to flavor it is a perfect poison,&#x201d; he would say. &#x201c;It produces the same feelings of aggression as amphetamines.&#x201d; Tonight he said nothing. Silently, he added a splash of soda and a slice of lemon to her glass and put it to the side while he refilled his own. Derek&#x2019;s preference was scotch, which he consumed in the British fashion: straight up&#x2014;no ice, no water, no soda.Scooping up the two glasses, he recrossed the room, handing the gin to Nancy and taking a seat across from her. As much out of habit as because of the heat, Derek had closed all the curtains so that they were sitting in the glow of a single lamp. The weak light threw Derek&#x2019;s craggy face into strong shadow, accentuating his nose and jutting chin, making him look positively fierce. The same light made Nancy appear soft and cuddly. At fifty-three she was still a good-looking woman, perky rather than pretty, petite with attractive, even features, a charming upturned nose, flashing brown eyes, and a fine, full figure. Plump some might say. But whenever she and Derek attended social functions, and that was often, Nancy never failed to draw stares from the men in the group. This raised conflicting emotions in Derek &#x2014;pride mixed with jealousy&#x2014;and usually sent him off on a tirade about how she undoubtedly would remarry quickly once he was out of the way. She laughed off those exhibitions, but as a woman with an almost insatiable need for attention and affection, she was secretly pleased with her lingering voluptuousness. Tonight, she had not bothered with makeup after her shower, and the lamplight made her appear unnaturally pale. Around her neck was a doublestranded gold choker, her only concession to formality for the evening. It glowed in the darkness.&#x201c;One more, please, dear,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;A little something while I&#x2019;m fixing dinner.&#x201d;While Derek mixed her another drink, Nancy put a pot of rice on to boil and attacked a mound of ground beef, shaping the meat into thick patties, which she slid into the oven.<br>&nbsp;NANCY RINSED THE PLATES AND STACKED THEM IN THE dishwasher, carefully culling the silverware because she always washed that by hand. In the dining room, Derek slumped peacefully at the table, enjoying the after-dinner quiet. It had been a long day, and he was falling victim to too much sun, too much scotch, and too much dinner. He was just about to nod off when there was a loud rapping at the door. He jerked upright. &#x201c;Bloody hell,&#x201d; he cursed, blinking and squinting at his watch. It was just past eight o&#x2019;clock.&#x201c;Are you expecting anyone?&#x201d; Nancy called from the kitchen.&#x201c;No,&#x201d; Derek grumbled, stretching like an old dog forced to surrender his favorite napping spot.Nancy poked her head through the serving door cut into the wall between the kitchen and dining room. &#x201c;I wonder who it might be?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll soon find out,&#x201d; replied Derek. Carefully placing his palms flat on the sturdy table, he used his powerful arms and shoulders to push himself upright. As he moved his chair back, it scraped across the slate floor like a fingernail being dragged down a chalkboard.&#x201c;I&#x2019;m coming,&#x201d; he yelled, setting off unsteadily across the room. After his shower Derek had changed into a pair of baggy work pants and a short-sleeved shirt, which was marked by dark half-circles under the arms. On his feet was a pair of new Indian-style moccasins, the kind in which the sole wraps around the foot to be joined to the upper by thick laces. As he walked, the leather made soft scuffling sounds on the uneven stone, the kind of soft whisking noise the barber used to make when he stropped his straight razor. The scotch had thrown Derek&#x2019;s internal compass askew, and he walked lopsidedly to the door.Nancy left the kitchen and crossed the dining room, silently watching her husband&#x2019;s erratic progress toward the door. She was more curious than anxious. Not many people arrived unannounced on a Saturday night, and she was eager to see who it was. Unconsciously, she brought her left hand to her breast and gathered the dashiki more tightly about her. Underneath the robe she wore only a beige bra and matching panties, not exactly the attire she would have preferred for welcoming guests.Derek paused at the door, fumbling with the light switches. The visitor thumped the knocker again. &#x201c;All <i>right,&#x201d;</i> Derek growled. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t be so bloody impatient.&#x201d; With his right hand, he flipped the switch closest to him, turning on a set of floodlights that bathed the top half of the driveway in harsh light. Clearly visible was the Haysoms&#x2019; creaky ten-year-old tan van, which Nancy had joshingly christened the Bronze Belle. To its right was their 1963 BMW sedan. Immediately in front of the door, side-by-side with the Belle, was a shiny new silver-blue subcompact that Derek had never seen before.Reaching up, Derek flipped a second switch. It controlled a single bulb over the doorway, and when it was lit, it threw heavy shadows on whomever happened to be standing on the stoop. Sometimes, depending on how close the caller was to the door, visual identification was tricky. But a nearly full moon eliminated that problem. Although he did not know the car, Derek immediately recognized the caller.&#x201c;Oh!&#x201d; he said in surprise. &#x201c;What are <i>you</i> doing here?&#x201d;&#x201c;I&#x2014;&#x201d; the visitor started, but he stopped when Nancy&#x2019;s head appeared over Derek&#x2019;s shoulder, a puzzled look on her face.&#x201c;Is Elizabeth with you?&#x201d; Nancy asked, peering into the darkness to see if she could see her daughter walking up the path.&#x201c;No,&#x201d; the visitor replied. &#x201c;I came alone.&#x201d; He was wearing jeans and, despite the warm night, a gray Members Only windbreaker. It effectively hid the layer of baby fat that still clung to his five-foot-eight frame. He wore thick-lensed spectacles and offered a tentative smile.&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this all about?&#x201d; Derek demanded in the gruff manner he used with those he did not particularly like. &#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d;&#x201c;Is anything the matter?&#x201d; Nancy interjected. &#x201c;Is Elizabeth all right?&#x201d;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s fine,&#x201d; the visitor said, shuffling nervously from foot to foot, bouncing in his white running shoes like a marathoner waiting for the starting gun. &#x201c;I came because I wanted to talk to you and your husband.&#x201d;Derek frowned. &#x201c;Talk to us? What about? Why isn&#x2019;t Lizzie with you?&#x201d; His tone was more than mildly belligerent.&#x201c;It&#x2019;s all right, Derek,&#x201d; Nancy said soothingly. Despite her gin-induced fog she felt the visitor&#x2019;s tension. It was palpable, as obvious as the darkness and the heat. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure there&#x2019;s a good reason,&#x201d; she whispered, laying a calming hand on her husband&#x2019;s forearm.Turning to the visitor, she flashed an airline hostess smile. &#x201c;Please come in,&#x201d; she said, trying to project a warmth she did not feel. &#x201c;We were just finishing dinner. Come in, and I&#x2019;ll fix you a plate.&#x201d;Copyright � 1990 by Ken Englade.</p><h2>Advent Light</h2><p>Threshold Bible Study is a thematic Scripture series designed for both personal study and group discussion.

Advent is a time for new understanding, for putting different pieces of God&#39;s revelation together so as to see the divine plan more clearly. We listen to the words of the ancient prophets, to the wisdom of Jesus, to the stories of his birth and infancy, and we make connections. Then we connect those truths to our own lives and our world and see how God is acting anew, how God continues to reveal the coming of Jesus today. Our best model for this Advent search for understanding is Mary of Nazareth. By making connections between the ancient and the new, between her people Israel and her own life, Mary grew in understanding of God&#39;s plan and responded to God&#39;s will with her acceptance: &#34;Let it be with me according to your word&#34; (LK 1:38).</p><p>The Threshold Bible Study is a thematic Scripture series designed for both personal study and group discussion.Stephen J.

The ten chapters of narrative are thoroughly detailed and well written, covering Karlsbad's historical position as a central glassmaking city, and revealing how the firm has remained established, even beyond WWII and the collapse of Communism. <p>There is splendid black and white photography - not previously shown - illustrating all kinds of the classical and figural motifs in which Moser specialized. Also present is an expanded 80-page section of color featuring new pieces not shown or identified in the first book.

Includes 1997-98 value guide.</p></p><p>The Bohemian city of Karlsbad occupied a major role in Central European history in the early 19th century. During its peak years of glass, porcelain and pottery production, Karlsbad literally &#34;etched&#34; itself a place on the map, particularly with respect to a firm called Moser. Gary Baldwin&#39;s Moser Artistic Glass, Edition Two offers a revised, updated edition of Moser - Artistry in Glass (1857-1938), and expounds on the Moser family history from the beginning of their involvement in the Bohemian glass movement to the continued success of the firm today.Gary Baldwin is a physicist who has been involved in laser research and infrared optical system development for over 35 years. Professionally, he has authored numerous technical articles, holds six patents, and is a member of the American Institute of Physics. Prior to 1970, Baldwin displayed little interest in any type of antiques. About 25 years ago, when an antiques market opened up in the Columbia Mall (Columbia, Maryland), Gary met a retired collector trying to sell some of his collection. The Baldwins purchased some of the pieces, two of which were Moser glass. Knowing nothing about Moser at the time, the beauty and intricacy of the pieces convinced Gary that this glass was to become his medium for collecting.</p><h2>Isaac Asimov Presents the Golden Years of Science Fiction, Sixth Series</h2><p>Stories tell of nuclear war survivors, extraterrestrial visitors, time travel, robots, space travel, telepathy, immortality, and other dimensions</p><p></p><h2>Embattled Confederacy: The Image of War, 1861-1865, Vol. 3 (The Image of War, 1861-1865, V. 3)</h2><p>Photographs show the aftermath at Antietam, Frederickburg, Chancellorsville, and Gettysburg, the addition of Black Union soldiers, and the blockade of the South</p><p></p><h2>Freddy and the Flying Saucer Plans (Freddy Books)</h2><p>These beloved classics are available now for the first time as Overlook paperbacks: Freddy the Pig, the &#34;Renaissance Pig&#34; (The New York Times Book Review) of Bean Farm, is back to thrill his fans of all ages in facsimile editions of these all-Am</p><p><b>Walter R.

After a short flirtation with Klimt&#x2019;s style, Schiele soon questioned the aesthetic orientation to the beautiful surface of the Viennese Art Nouveau with his rough and not easily accessible paintings.<br> <br> Many contemporaries found Schiele&#x2019;s expressive nudes and self-portraits, with their strange movements and morbid colours, to be ugly and even morally objectionable--criticism which culminated in criminalizing the painter as &#x2019;obscene&#x2019; and resulted in 1912 in an indictment and short jail sentence. However, not even his harshest critics could dispute the artist&#x2019;s extraordinary drawing talent. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art Series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 colour illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>The author: Reinhard Steiner (born 1950) is professor of art history at the University of Stuttgart.

This book focuses on the third: the role of U.S. and European churches, academics, think-tanks, foundations, government and human rights groups in fostering separation of the identities of Dravidian and Dalit communities from the rest of India. The book is the result of five years of research, and uses information obtained in the West about foreign funding of these Indian-based activities. The research tracked the money trails that start out claiming to be for education,A&#34; &#34;human rights,&#34; empowerment training,A&#34; and leadership training,A&#34; but end up in programs designed to produce angry youths who feel disenfranchised from Indian identity. The book reveals how outdated racial theories continue to provide academic frameworks and fuel the rhetoric that can trigger civil wars and genocides in developing countries. The Dravidian movement&#39;s 200-year history has such origins. Its latest manifestation is the Dravidian ChristianityA&#34; movement that fabricates a political and cultural history to exploit old faultlines. The book explicitly names individuals and institutions, including prominent Western ones and their Indian affiliates. Its goal is to spark an honest debate on the extent to which human rights and other empowermentA&#34; projects are cover-ups for these nefarious activities.</p><p>Rajiv Malhotra is a public intellectual on current affairs, world religions and cross-cultural encounters between East and West.

The books that followed--<b>The Viceroy of Ouidah</b>, <b>On the Black Hill</b>, <b>The Songlines</b>, and <b>Utz</b>--confirmed his status as a major writer able to reinvent himself constantly.

Salman Rushdie claimed that "he had the most erudite and possibly the most brilliant mind I ever came across."<br><br>And yet for all the adoration he received, when Chatwin died of AIDS in 1989, he died an enigma, a panoply of apparently conflicting identities.

The result is this definitive biography rendered in a graceful narrative that brilliantly leads us into Chatwin's world, from the glittering dinner tables among the famous to foreign deserts among nomads, and into his psyche. --&gt;</p><p>Bruce Chatwin was the golden child of contemporary English letters. Paradoxically, however, his books appeared relatively late in his life: until 1977, when the 37-year-old author published <i>In Patagonia</i>, this precocious, intense figure had occupied himself as an art specialist at Sotheby's, a journalist with the Sunday <i>Times</i>, an archaeologist, and a restless, perennial traveler. Once he got started, of course, Chatwin made up for lost time. By 1989, when he died of an AIDS-related illness, he had produced seven books--including two superb novels and his sui generis masterpiece, <i>The Songlines</i>--and won himself a worldwide audience.<p> As Nicholas Shakespeare makes clear in <i>Bruce Chatwin</i>, his subject remained an obsessive art collector long after he left Sotheby's. He was no less assiduous when it came to the acquisition of human trophies, taking both male and female lovers throughout the course of his marriage. Many a wife might have resented these magpie impulses--and indeed, Elizabeth Chatwin and her errant spouse endured some rocky times. Yet she remained touchingly loyal to him, and it was her cooperation and tenacity that enabled this biography to come about. Shakespeare captures the author's peculiar charisma and his tendency to transform everything--friendships, landscapes, meals, journeys--into aesthetic artifacts. Even when Chatwin experiences a writer's block while working on <i>The Viceroy of Ouidah</i>, he does it with <i>style</i>: </p><blockquote> To try to finish the book, Bruce rented a house in Ronda for five months: "an exquisite neo-Classical pavilion restored by an Argentinean architect who has run out of money." He wrote in longhand on 20 yellow legal pads, refilling his Mont Blanc from two bottles of Asprey's brown ink. </blockquote> There is excellent, evocative writing throughout Shakespeare's biography. The passages describing Chatwin's miserable death are both harrowing and deeply moving, but Shakespeare is no less adept at conveying, say, his subject's disappointment at failing to win the Booker Prize for <i>Utz</i>. (Chatwin cheered up considerably when a friend told him that Alberto Moravia had given the book a glowing thumbs-up in an Italian newspaper.) What comes across most, perhaps, in this immense and excellent life, is the complete aloneness of the man, an almost impenetrable solitude. Australian poet Les Murray may have had the last word when he noted: "He was lonely and he wanted to be. He had those blue, implacable eyes that said: 'I will reject you, I will forget you, because neither you nor any other human being can give me what I want.'" <i>--Catherine Taylor</i>"In Nicholas Shakespeare, Chatwin has found the right biographer. This is a magnificent work of empathy and detection."<br>--Colin Thubron, <i>The Sunday Times</i> (London)<br><br>"An epic work of immense satisfaction. In awe-inspiring detail and with a rounding-out of all the other characters, Shakespeare takes us successively through the milieux of Chatwin's life--and drenches all these worlds in their emotional, human implications."<br>--Duncan Fallowell, <i>The Times</i> (London)<br><br>"Biographies don't come any better than this. Eight years in the writing, Bruce Chatwin is a glorious quilt-work of texts, voices, and places, joined together with consummate judgment."<br>--Justin Wintle, <i>Financial Times</i> (London)<br><br>"Nicholas Shakespeare's biography feels concise: comprehensively researched, elegantly written, perfectly balanced between the life, the books, and the ideas."<br>--Blake Morrison, <i>Independent on Sunday</i></p><h2>Paris</h2><p>As a photographer, Robert Doisneau is known for his ability to infuse images of daily life with poetic nuance that imbued his photojournalism with an enduring popular appeal. The unprecedented scope of this collection provides the opportunity to study his more composed, aesthetically structured images alongside his snapshots, which offer a more anecdotal account of Doisneau&#39;s Paris. Organized thematically, the book leads us on an entrancing tour through the gardens of Paris, along the Seine, and through the crowds of Parisians who define their beloved city. More than 600 photographs-many rare, forgotten, and previously unpublished-are assembled in this beautiful volume to create a unique portrait of Paris. From toddlers scrambling to cross rue de Rivoli to fresh-faced accordionists, from elegant dog walkers to exuberant roller skaters, and from the indelible kiss in front of the H�tel de Ville to cyclists beneath the Eiffel Tower, the magic of Paris in black and white is a timeless treasure. The photographs, edited by Doisneau&#39;s daughter, are complemented by citations from the photographer himself, which reveal his profound fascination with the city where he lived and worked.</p><p>Robert Doisneau (1912-1994) is one of the world&#39;s most famous and popular photographers. His poetic, touching, and at times nostalgic images of France have become iconic. He did a stint at Vogue, but his real interest lay in capturing on film ordinary people in everyday situations. He received many prizes during his life; since his death in 1994 there have been major retrospectives of his work in Paris, Chicago (The Art Institute), and New York (the Witkin Gallery). Francine Derondille is Doisneau&#39;s daughter.Photographer Doisneau (1912&#x2013;1994) had a tremendous gift not only for portraying the beauty of Paris but for capturing the charm of its citizens; some of his images have come to define Paris, even for those who've never visited. Most of the 600 photos in this classic collection feature at least one person, and the expressions on their faces are so real they feel staged. One, of a young woman finishing a roller-coaster ride, catches her with a look of "<i>mon dieu</i>, I thought I'd die!" The way Doisneau composes his images, focusing on a subject's "aura" ("that kind of neon light," he says, glowing around certain people) is striking. He possesses a satirical eye for humor (e.g., the shots of various sculptures doused in pigeon droppings) and the bizarre (a Monsieur Beauvoir sitting at a bar with a large bird perched on his shoulder). The chapters are broadly thematic (the one on war and politics is particularly powerful); within chapters, there are themes: e.g., butchers, the M�tro, visitors observing the <i>Mona Lisa</i>. Doisneau's commentary appears throughout, as his photographs&#x2014;whether from the 1940s or the 1990s&#x2014;illustrate a society that is alternately refined, puzzling and, above all, human. <i>(Nov.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He is not only one of the premier writers in Britain but his prize-winning work has long been admired and recognized in France. In these exquisitely crafted and turned stories spanning several centuries, Julian Barnes takes as his universal theme the British in France, our fascination with the country, our various and mixed reasons for being there and our sometimes ambiguous reception.</p><p>collection of short stories, Barnes explores the narrow body of water containing the vast sea of prejudice and misapprehension which lies between England and France with acuity humor, and compassion. For whether Barnes's English characters come to France as conquerors or hostages, laborers, athletes, or aesthetes, what they discover, alongside rich food and barbarous sexual and religious practices, is their own ineradicable Englishness. The ten stories that make up <b>Cross Channel</b> introduce us to a plethora of intriguing, original, and sometimes ill-fated characters.

Parkers Damned If You Do (A Jesse Stone Novel)</h2><p>Police chief Jesse Stone uncovers a turf war between rival pimps after a young woman is found murdered in a shabby beach motel.</p><p>Robert B. Parker was the author of seventy books, including the legendary Spenser detective series, the novels featuring Chief Jesse Stone, and the acclaimed Virgil Cole/Everett Hitch Westerns, as well as the Sunny Randall novels. Winner of the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award and long considered the undisputed dean of American crime fiction, he died in January 2010. <br>Michael Brandman is the author of the "New York Times-"bestsellers "Robert B. Parker's Fool Me Twice "and "Robert B. Parker's Killing the Blues." An award-winning producer of more than thirty motion pictures, he collaborated with Robert B. Parker for years on movie projects, Spenser TV movies, and the Jesse Stone series of TV movies starring Tom Selleck. He worked on the adaptations of "Stone Cold, Night Passage, Death in Paradise, " and "Sea Change," and wrote and produced the original screenplays for "Thin Ice, No Remorse, Innocents Lost," and "Benefit of the Doubt." He lives in California.The girl is young, pretty, and looks vaguely familiar to Paradise Police Chief Jesse Stone. She&#x2019;s also dead. She checked into the decaying bungalow resort with cash and an alias: undoubtedly, a working girl. Jesse feels he at least needs to determine her identity to avoid the indignity of an unmarked Jane Doe grave. The man who might provide a starting point is Gino Fish, the Boston crime boss. Gino claims to know nothing, but he sends a pimp named Thomas Walker to Stone. Meanwhile, Stone is dealing with a nursing-home runaway who happens to be an old friend with midstage Alzheimer&#x2019;s. He&#x2019;s being mistreated, but how do you take down a billion-dollar health-care conglomerate? In the end, Jesse has a more favorable view of the sex industry than he does of some health-care purveyors. Brandman, who worked closely with Parker on the Jesse Stone television movies, does a fine job moving the Jesse Stone series forward. He continues to be the gold standard for mystery writers attempting to preserve the Parker brand. --Wes Lukowsky</p><h2>It&#39;s a Magical World</h2><p>This collection of cartoons features Calvin and Hobbes .

It seeks to answer the questions: "Who are we?" and "Why are we here, on this planet?" It is offered to those who are looking for something beyond the superficial values of our culture, who may be disillusioned with religious and secular belief systems as currently presented and who question political values which are deeply mired in the pursuit of power. It is written with two voices: one the voice of a personal quest and the other which explores the historical and psychological causes that have brought into being our present view of reality.</p></p><p>Anne Baring has devoted her life to humanity's recovery of the <i>anima mundi</i> - the soul of the world, and indeed its own soul. <i>The Dream of the Cosmos</i> is the climax of that quest, the fruit of a lifetime of thought and feeling, learning and vision. It is the story of a dramatic personal journey, but also an attempt to confront the greatest issues facing our time. Every page breathes her moral passion, her love of beauty, her spiritual aspiration, her deep care for the Earth. Above all, Anne Baring calls for a fundamental transformation in the way human beings live on this Earth and with each other. It would not be too much to say that this book is a <i>cri de coeur</i> from a place deep in the collective psyche that carries not only our past but our future. <i>The Dream of the Cosmos </i>pulses with the fierce tenderness and grave urgency of love for an infinitely precious new human being that is struggling to be born.<br> <br> Richard Tarnas, author of <i>The Passion of the Western Mind </i>and<i> Cosmos and Psyche</i><br> <br><br>Anne Baring is one of the great pioneers on the Divine Feminine of our time. Her work is a marvelous marriage of profound learning, deep and mature mystical experience and a vivid immediate gift of communication. Her latest book, <i>The Dream of the Cosmos</i>, is the consummation of her life's work, twenty years in the making. It is a masterpiece that will last a long time and deserves to be read by all seekers and anyone interested in the birth of a new civilization out of the chaos of our time.<br> <br>&nbsp;Andrew Harvey, author of <i>Return of the Mother</i> and <i>Radical Passion</i>As Anne Baring writes in her opening, this book is a vocation. It is the opus magnum for which one might say, without exaggeration, Anne has incarnated in this lifetime to produce for the benefit of many. The Dream of the Cosmos is at once both a visionary autobiography including many of Anne's own dreams, and a comprehensive archetypal history of the constellation, separation from, and resurgence of the feminine. Included in this deep scholarship are profound insights into the origins of misogyny as well as the soulful claims of instinct and its dangerous shadows expressed in violence and oppression. Anne leads us on a remarkable journey to understand the roots of our current suffering and the way forward to embrace a new and necessary sacred vision of reality--one supported by the new sciences--that includes the whole of nature and the cosmos.

Among these myths are that free trade and population growth have historically led to periods of economic growth, and that colonial powers in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries became rich through the exploitation of the Third World. Bairoch shows that these beliefs are based on insufficient knowledge and wrong interpretations of the history of economies of the United States, Europe, and the Third World, and he re-examines the facts to set the record straight. Bairoch argues that until the early 1960s, the history of international trade of the developed countries was almost entirely one of protectionism rather than a &#34;Golden Era&#34; of free trade, and he reveals that, in fact, past periods of economic growth in the Western World correlated strongly with protectionist policy. He also demonstrates that developed countries did not exploit the Third World for raw materials during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, as some economists and many politicians have held. Among the many other myths that Bairoch debunks are beliefs about whether colonization triggered the Industrial Revolution, the effects of the economic development of the West on the Third World, and beliefs about the 1929 crash and the Great Depression. Bairoch&#39;s lucid prose makes the book equally accessible to economists of every stripe, as well as to historians, political scientists, and other social scientists.Paul Bairoch is professor of economic history at the University of Geneva.</p><h2>Little Bo in France</h2><p>Little Bo and her dear master, Billy, embark on a thrilling journey as they travel from England to the south of France in search of work and adventure.

Her website is www.gracelin.com.*Starred Review* Sisters Ling and Ting may be twins, but that doesn&#x2019;t mean they&#x2019;re &#x201c;exactly the same,&#x201d; no matter what everyone says upon first meeting them. Children will come to their own conclusions after reading the six short, interconnected stories that make up this pleasing book for beginning readers. In the first chapter, &#x201c;The Haircuts,&#x201d; Ling sneezes while her bangs are being cut, and for a while at least, it&#x2019;s easy to tell the twins apart. The chapters that follow reveal distinct differences in the sisters&#x2019; personalities, inclinations, and abilities. Despite those differences, in the end each girl subtly affirms her affection for the other. Framed with narrow borders, the paintings illustrate the stories with restrained lines, vivid colors, and clarity. The chapters often end with mildly humorous turns, from a neat play on words to a smack-your-heard obvious solution to an apparently impossible dilemma. These endings, as well as bits of comic byplay that occur in the brief framework vignettes, will suit the target audience beautifully. Lin, whose previous books include Dim Sum for Everyone (2001) and the 2010 Newbery Honor Book Where the Mountain Meets the Moon (2009), shows her versatility once again in an original book that tells its story clearly while leaving room for thought and discussion.

In doing so, Archaic Smile continually bridges the gap between these two distant but interrelated worlds with striking insights. James Dickey, having praised the author&#39;s accomplished critical skills, also points out that she has &#34;the most indispensable quality that a poet must have: an original way of looking at things.&#34; A.R. Ammons aptly characterizes the power of her mythological poems in his comments on &#34;Apollo Takes Charge of His Muses&#34; which he chose for The Best American Poetry: &#34;It delivers the ancient past into our present with such astonishing justness that I&#39;m silenced with appreciation.&#34; Archaic Smile is a powerful debut collection by a provacative poet who has found strikingly original ways to personalize our myths and conjure the deep significances of our everyday life.</p><p>A.E.

It has had the most profound and wide-reaching influence of any text in Buddhism. Its full title, Prajna Paramita Hrdaya Sutra, "The Sutra of the Heart of the Perfection of Wisdom," explains that this sutra contains the essence of the Buddha&#x2019;s teaching, the core of perfect enlightenment. It is the source of the famous and puzzling declaration, "form is emptiness, emptiness is form." For this new translation into English, Red Pine, award-winning translator of Chinese poetry and religious texts, has utilized various Sanskrit and Chinese versions, refining the teachings of dozens of ancient teachers together with his own commentary to offer a profound word-for-word explication. The result is a wise book of deep teaching destined to become the standard edition of this timeless statement of Mahayana truth.<br><br>Gate. Gate. Paragate. Parasungate. Bodhi. Svaha.<br></p><p>The Heart Sutra, a mere 35 lines, is one of Buddhism's best-known teachings, "Buddhism in a nutshell," according to Red Pine, an award-winning translator of Chinese poetry and religious writings. But when he was asked to prepare a fresh translation, he found himself reconsidering its origins, reexamining every word, and reassessing every nuance. The result is a meticulous line-by-line interpretation that will radically deepen readers' understanding of not only the sutra but also Buddhism's underlying structure, Abhidharma, or the Matrix of Reality. Red Pine begins by noting that while no one knows where the Heart Sutra came from or who composed it, he has come to believe that its roots are in Northern India, and that "the noble Avalokiteshvara Bodhisattva" named in the first line is none other than an incarnation of Maya, the Buddha's mother.

This book answers these questions, and more.<br><br>The text, photography, and graphics demonstrate that most of what we see today is young, geologically speaking - the product of volcanic eruptions, profound glaciation, and earth movements.<br><br>Perhaps the most interesting of all, the book describes how processes originating half way to the earth's center seem to be the primary force which created volcanic fires, glacial ice, and the mountain ranges of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem.<br></p><p></p><h2>Monsieur de Saint-George: &#34;The American&#34;</h2><p>His life is the stuff of legend: born in 1739 of a slave mother and a French noble father, he became the finest swordsman of his age, an insider at the court of The Sun King, and, most of all, an accomplished musician who came to be known as the &#x201c;Black Mozart.&#x201d; <br><br>His name is Joseph Bologne, though he was better known as Monsieur de Saint-George, and, because of his origins, &#x201c;the American.&#x201d; Alain Gu�d� recreates the story of this memorable individual, whose musical compositions are at long last being rediscovered and whose story will never again be forgotten.<br></p><p>Alain Gu�d� is a French journalist.

The collection will include enthralling masterpieces such as LT&#39;s THEORY OF PETS, IN THE DEATHROOM and 1408; classic tales of supernatural and psychological terror and tales of everyday life with unexpected and brilliant twists such as AUTOPSY ROOM FOUR. It will also contain the highly publicised RIDING THE BULLET, only previously available as an ebook. The stories are new or have only been published as audio books, in magazines or limited book collections.</p><p>In his introduction to <i>Everything's Eventual</i>, horror author extraordinaire Stephen King describes how he used a deck of playing cards to select the order in which these 14 tales of the macabre would appear. Judging by the impact of these stories, from the first words of the darkly fascinating "Autopsy Room Four" to the haunting final pages of "Luckey Quarter," one can almost believe King truly is guided by forces from beyond.<p> His first collection of short stories since the release of <i>Nightmares &amp; Dreamscapes</i> in 1993, <i>Everything's Eventual</i> represents King at his most undiluted. The short story format showcases King's ability to spook readers using the most mundane settings (a yard sale) and comfortable memories (a boyhood fishing excursion). The dark tales collected here are some of King's finest, including an O. Henry Prize winner and "Riding the Bullet," published originally as an e-book and at one time expected by some to be the death knell of the physical publishing world. True to form, each of these stories draws the reader into King's slightly off-center world from the first page, developing characters and atmosphere more fully in the span of 50 pages than many authors can in a full novel.</p><p> For most rabid King fans, chief among the tales in this volume will be "The Little Sisters of Eluria," a novella that first appeared in the fantasy collection <i>Legends</i>, set in King's ever-expanding Dark Tower universe. In this story, set prior to the first Dark Tower volume, the reader finds Gunslinger Roland of Gilead wounded and under the care of nurses with very dubious intentions. Also included in this collection are "That Feeling, You Can Only Say What It Is in French," the story of a woman's personal hell; "1408," in which a writer of haunted tour guides finally encounters the real thing; "Everything's Eventual," the title story, about a boy with a dream job that turns out to be more of a nightmare; and "L.T.'s Theory of Pets," a story of divorce with a bloody surprise ending.</p><p> King also includes an introductory essay on the lost art of short fiction and brief explanatory notes that give the reader background on his intentions and inspirations for each story. As with any occasion when King directly addresses his dear Constant Readers, his tone is that of a camp counselor who's almost apologetic for the scare his fireside tales are about to throw into his charges, yet unwilling to soften the blow. And any campers gathered around this author's fire would be wise to heed his warnings, for when King goes bump in the night, it's never just a branch on the window. <i>--Benjamin Reese</i></p><b>Stephen King</b> is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

P. Shiel's&nbsp;<i>The Purple Cloud</i>&nbsp;is a landmark work that heralded the genre of apocalyptic fiction.

A deadly purple vapor passes over the world and annihilates all living creatures except one man, Adam Jeffson. He embarks on an epic journey across a silent and devastated planet, an apocalyptic Robinson Crusoe putting together the semblance of a normal life from the flotsam and jetsam of his former existence. As he descends into madness over the years, he becomes increasingly aware that his survival was no accident and that his destiny -- and the fate of the human race -- are part of a profound, cosmological plan.<b>M.

He lives in Fort Worth, Texas.</p> <br><br>Working with two tellers of the tribal history, Miss Charles Emily Wilson and Willie Warrior, Texas journalist Guinn interviewed more than two dozen people to produce a compelling narrative of the Seminole Negro (pronounced "Nay-gro") tribe's origins and history. In the 18th century, escaped African slaves fled south into Spanish-held Florida and allied themselves with the Seminole Indians, in effect making themselves into a separate tribe. When the Americans under Andrew Jackson invaded Florida, the Negro Seminoles fought side by side with Indian allies to defend villages and land. After the bloodletting of the Seminole Wars of the early 19th century, the Seminole Negroes were removed from Florida and settled in the Indian Territory of what is now Oklahoma. Miserable and alone, most of the tribe walked off the reservation and migrated to Mexico. After the American Civil War, the U.S. government needed troops to help defend the Texas border against Comanches and Apaches, and the group returned and enlisted as scouts to help "pacify" Texas. Four Seminoles earned Medals of Honor for their brave deeds, and the tribe was promised a land of its own. Instead, the Seminoles Negro tribe was disbanded in 1914, and its families were evicted from government-owned land. To this day, their descendants still cry for justice and for a land to call their own. The tribe gathers yearly in Brackettville, Tex., to tell stories to their young people, maintain a cemetery and keep alive their heritage. Guinn depicts all of this clearly and without sentiment, and includes his own involvement with the tribe as part of the narrative, making this an authoritative story of the pursuit of truth.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>One Third of a Nation: Lorena Hickok Reports on the Great Depression</h2><p>Between 1933 and 1935, Lorena Hickok traveled across thirty-two states as a "confidential investigator" for Harry Hopkins, head of FDR's Federal Emergency Relief Administration.

Her observations still provide uncommon perspicacity.&#34; -- Dennis Shockley, The Chronicles of Oklahoma ADVANCE PRAISE &#34;Lorena Hickok was a singularly gifted witness to the calamity of the Great Depression. From one end of the country to the other, she stared long and hard into the human face of America&#39;s greatest economic failure and social catastrophe.

From the beaches of Normandy and the South Pacific Islands to the deserts of the Middle East, the American soldier has been the most indispensable- and most overlooked-factor in wartime victory. In Grunts, renowned historian John C. McManus covers six decades of warfare, examining ten critical battles-from the Battle of the Bulge to counterinsurgency combat in Iraq-where the skills and courage of American troops proved the crucial difference between victory and defeat. Based on years of research and interviews with veterans, this powerful history reveals the ugly face of war in a way few books have, and demonstrates the fundamental, and too often forgotten, importance of the human element in serving and protecting the nation.</p><p><b>John C. McManus</b> is Associate Professor of U.S. Military History at Missouri University of Science and Technology. He's authored numerous books and is a frequent contributor to <i>World War II</i> magazine."Urging better recognition of the critical role and central importance of the combat soldier, without whom he says no nation can be safe or strong... full of valuable insights." <br> -<i>Kirkus</i> <br><br> "...another demonstration of [John C. McManus's] skill at narrating infantry combat... Both readable and persuasive." <br> -<i>Booklist</i> <br><br> "A superb book-an American equivalent to John Keegan's <i>The Face of Battle</i>. I sincerely believe that <i>Grunts</i> is destined to be a classic...It's a powerful look into the hearts and minds of the American 'grunt,' the infantryman, the marine, the frontline warrior who exists at the crux of war, and is the true heart and soul of warfare." <br> -Lt. Col. Dave Grossman, U.S. Army (ret.), author of <i>On Killing</i> and <i>On Combat</i> <br><br> "A superbly written, highly fitting tribute to the courage and sacrifice of the unsung heroes who have shouldered the main burden of horrific combat-and suffered the lion's share of casualties-while fighting America's wars. McManus captures-with gritty, 'muddy boot' authenticity-the horrors of the real war fought by America's frontline soldiers and Marines. Reading <i>Grunts</i> is the closest you will get to experiencing actual infantry combat without getting shot at." <br> -Jerry D. Morelock, Ph.D., Col. U.S. Army, (Ret.), and Editor in Chief of <i>Armchair General</i> <br><br> "From Banzai charges on Pacific Islands to bombs in the streets of Baghdad, <i>Grunts</i> plunges us into the hellish, heroic world of the American Infantryman. This powerful book drives home the unfiltered ferocity of combat- and both the comradeship and loneliness of the soldier or Marine who pays the butcher's bill for plans concocted by men he'll never meet. When all of the new technologies have been exhausted, the infantryman's timeless lot is still to face death at close quarters. Author John C. McManus makes it shatteringly real, and Grunts is hypnotic history writing: honest, savage, heartbreaking and, ultimately, inspiring." <br> -Ralph Peters, Fox News Strategic Analyst and author of <i>The War After Armageddon</i> <br><br> "A literary and historical achievement of the highest order, <i>Grunts</i> illuminates the experience of the American GI better than any book I have read in years. Using battles such as Peleliu and Fallujah, John McManus brilliantly proves, using the participants' own words, that the American warrior, not technology, wins wars." <br> -Patrick K. O'Donnell, author of <i>Give Me Tomorrow</i> <br><br> "Too frequently historians take humanity out of war. McManus skillfully puts man back into the history of America's recent wars, reminding us that man is still the determining factor." <br> -Adrian R. Lewis, Professor, University of Kansas <br><br> "John C. McManus's <i>Grunts</i> contains some of the most vivid accounts of close combat ever recorded in literature. The reader has the sense of being actually present in the battles. His descriptions show precise details of combat at the closest personal levels and with absolute authenticity." <br> -Bevin Alexander, combat historian in the Korean War and author of <i>Inside the Nazi War Machine</i></p><h2>Bound to Lose Destined to Win</h2><p>In this book, pastor and former heavyweight boxer Earthquake Kelley shares an extraordinary story of his experiences as a child being trained in voodoo, and the testimony of his salvation and deliverance.

You'll learn how to eat balanced meals: 40 percent of your calories coming from carbohydrates, 30 percent from protein and 30 percent from fat. You'll begin to burn fat, add muscle and increase your metabolism. Best of all, your body will keep the weight off once you reach your goal.</p></p><p>Eating the right balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fat creates a hormonal response that leads to burning stored fat for energy, claim nutritionists Joyce and Gene Daoust. This book explains how the 40-30-30 diet works (40 percent high fiber, mostly low-glycemic carbohydrate; 30 percent high-quality protein; 30 percent fat), and how to plan meals following this formula. The "Sample Starter Meal Planners" are organized into three meal categories: Regular, Fat-Flush, and Vegetarian (heavy on cheese, eggs, tofu, and tempeh). There are a few recipes, such as Hearty Chili, Teriyaki Chicken Kabobs, Pizza, and Tortilla Turkey Roll-Up, and many quickly assembled meals, such as Scrambled Eggs, Tuna on Rye Crackers, and Open-Faced Ham Sandwich. A food value guide gives the protein, carbohydrate, and fat grams of many common foods. Though some nutrition experts would argue that this diet is too low in carbohydrates and too high in protein, the Daousts say that "There are no good or bad foods....The key is achieving the proper <i>balance</i> of the foods that you eat."Joyce and Gene Daoust are certified nutritionists and former directors and co-founders of the bio-Syn Human Performance Center, a cutting-edge weight-loss and sports nutrition clinic in Redmond, Washington.</p><h2>This Christmas Night: Reflections from Our Hearts to Your Home</h2><p><p>Christmas is more than a date on the calendar.

James Holman (1786-1857) became "one of the greatest wonders of the world he so sagaciously explored," triumphing not only over blindness but crippling pain, poverty, and the interference of well-meaning authorities (his greatest feat, a circumnavigation of the globe, had to be launched in secret). Once a celebrity, a bestselling author, and an inspiration to Charles Darwin and Sir Richard Francis Burton, the charismatic, witty Holman outlived his fame, dying in an obscurity that has endured -- until now.</p><p><em>A Sense of the World</em> is a spellbinding and moving rediscovery of one of history's most epic lives. Drawing on meticulous research, Jason Roberts ushers us into the Blind Traveler's uniquely vivid sensory realm, then sweeps us away on an extraordinary journey across the known world during the Age of Exploration. Rich with suspense, humor, international intrigue, and unforgettable characters, this is a story to awaken our own senses of awe and wonder.</p></p><p><p>Jason Roberts is the inaugural winner of the Van Zorn Prize for emerging writers (sponsored by Michael Chabon) and a contributor to the <em>Village Voice, McSweeney's, The Believer,</em> and other publications. He lives in Northern California.</p>Before there were cars, long-distance buses, high-speed trains and jet airplanes, there was a man who traveled a quarter of a million miles. He did it by cart, by carriage, by sledge, by ship and by foot. And he did it "intermittently crippled" and "permanently blind." His name was James Holman, and for a time he was the most famous of the many intrepid English travelers who set out for faraway places at the end of the Napoleonic Wars.<p> Holman and his heroic achievements are all but forgotten today. Long before his death in 1857, he had faded into lonely obscurity, a relic of a romantic, pre-mechanized age. Jason Roberts first saw mention of him in a slim book called Eccentric Travelers. But Holman's only eccentricity was his urgent need "to cling to the road like a lifeline," writes Roberts in A Sense of the World, an eloquent and sympathetic biography of the long-gone voyager.</p><p> Holman's afflictions were somewhat mysterious. Born in Essex in 1786, he'd gone to sea in the Royal Navy at the age of 12. After three years spent on the damp, frigid deck of the HMS Cambrian, a frigate based out of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Holman developed what seemed to be rheumatism, an old man's illness that afflicted many young sailors. When he sought a cure in Bath, his rheumatic symptoms eased, but he lost his sight mysteriously and completely. </p><p> Roberts is gruesomely thorough in depicting the perils -- mostly from the medical profession -- that threatened the blind in the early 19th century. "In 1811," writes Roberts, "even the most enlightened medical professional knew no more about the eye than might a curious butcher." Cures for blindness included leeches, couching (poking a thick needle into the pupil) and setons (threads sewn vertically between the shoulder blades "to draw down the head's malignant humors"; they invariably became septic). If none of those methods worked (and it was pure luck if they did), the blind could expect a life of reliance on charity: "Almost no one wanted to hire the blind . . . . Most sighted people were unsettled by [their] presence," writes Roberts. </p><p>But Holman rejected every curb on his independence. He refused to wear the customary rag over his eyes, and he developed a surefire way of moving around on his own: a metal walking stick that produced "an authoritative series of taps" allowing him to navigate by sound. And to avoid outright charity, he finagled a lifetime appointment as a Naval Knight of Windsor, which provided him with lodging and a stipend as long as he attended daily service in the castle's chapel.</p><p> Holman did not attend chapel for long. His health began to fail, and his doctors conveniently prescribed convalescence in sunny France. It was Holman's first solo journey in a foreign country, and he found it exhilarating. Likely, his doctors did not envision the sort of footloose travel cure that he came to favor. Granted a one-year leave from the Naval Knights, he was away for two, traveling through much of Europe, never staying in one place very long. Travel, he quickly realized, was "the only thing keeping him alive." </p><p>When he returned, he wrote a bestselling book of his journeys that earned him the sobriquet the "Blind Traveler." And he began making ambitious (and surreptitious) plans to circumnavigate the globe. His poverty dictated his itinerary -- and his wish to circumvent officious friends dictated the secretiveness. He decided to go by land through Russia, traveling like the "impoverished peasantry . . . in simple horse-drawn carts and wheel-less sledges" and saving money "by engaging no guide or translator, trusting himself to pick up the notoriously difficult Russian language in transit." His friends would have been right to interfere. "Reaching the Pacific this way," writes Roberts, "meant crossing some of the world's coldest, harshest, and least-charted terrain, lands so bleak that even the more hospitable parts had been serving as a much-dreaded penal colony for almost two centuries."</p><p>But nothing could have pleased Holman more, as he later wrote: "I was engaged under circumstances of unusual occurrence, in a solitary journey of several thousand miles,through a country, perhaps the wildest on the face of the earth, and whose inhabitants were scarcely yet accounted within the pale of civilization; with no other attendant than a rude Tartar postillion, to whose language my ear was wholly unaccustomed. And yet I was supported by a feeling of happy confidence." </p><p>And he almost pulled it off, making it as far as Irkutsk, "the world's most isolated city," when the czar got wind of the traveling Englishman. Fearing that Holman would discover the extent of Russia's forays into North America, Czar Alexander had the blind man unceremoniously kidnapped and dumped on the Polish border.</p><p> Holman's Russian troubles weren't over when he returned to England. There, he discovered that a treacherous fellow traveler had leveled charges that would dog Holman for rest of his life. John Dundas Cochrane, known as the "Pedestrian Traveler," had made it almost as far across Russia as Holman had, on foot. But in his account of his journey, he made Holman into "a sort of harbinger marking the end of risk," asking "Who will then say that Siberia is a wild, inhospitable, or impassible country, when even the blind can traverse it with safety?" </p><p> While that charge -- that if the blind Holman could make the journey, it was no great traveling feat -- became a theme of later reviews of Holman's books, it hardly dampened his wanderlust. Into his sixth decade, he was "an intrepid invalid (at times simultaneously incapable of standing up and standing still)." He embarked on what was for the Royal Navy "the deadliest expedition of all time" to the miasmic African island of Fernando Po, an outpost for attacks on the slave trade. From there, he went on to Buenos Aires, South Africa, Madagascar, India, China, Australia and beyond. "Somewhere in the Atlantic, approaching England, Holman at last completed his circuit of the world," writes Roberts.</p><p> Holman died alone in London, a week after finishing the autobiography that he hoped would be his claim to long-lasting fame. That book was never published; his heir lost the manuscript. But at last Holman has an enthusiastic champion. Perhaps too enthusiastic: Roberts is rather quick to defend some of Holman's more egregious errors, including his tendency to pad his books with unreliable accounts of places to which he'd never traveled. And yet his obvious admiration for Holman is right and proper: The man "could claim a thorough acquaintance with every inhabited continent, and direct contact with at least two hundred distinctly separate cultures," and he did so by willing himself forward, past every obstacle. Roberts's vibrant prose and meticulous recreation of Holman's world offer modern readers a chance to see what Holman saw as he tapped his way around the globe. </p><p>Reviewed by Rachel Hartigan Shea <br>Copyright 2006, The Washington Post.

An agitated female voice cried:</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s...Mar�a&#x2019;s killed herself...I...it&#x2019;s horrible...horrible!&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s your name, please?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ka &#x2013; Karen.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Where are you calling from?&#x2019; the emergency operator asked.</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;m at...it&#x2019;s...her holiday cottage...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Where? Where is it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;...At Lake Thingvallavatn. At...at her holiday cottage. Please hurry...I...I&#x2019;ll be here...&#x2019;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Karen thought she would never find the cottage. It had been a long time, nearly four years, since her last visit. Mar�a had given her detailed directions just to be on the safe side, but they had more or less gone in one ear and out the other because Karen had assumed she would remember the way.</p><p>It was past eight in the evening and pitch dark by the time she left Reykjav�k. She drove over Mosfellsheidi moor where there was little traffic, just the odd pair of headlights passing by on their way to town. Only one other car was travelling east and she hung on its red rear lights, grateful for the company. She didn&#x2019;t like driving alone in the dark and would have set off earlier if she hadn&#x2019;t been held up. She worked in the public-relations department of a large bank and it had seemed as if the meetings and phone calls would never let up.</p><p>Karen was aware of the mountain Gr�mannsfell to her right, although she couldn&#x2019;t see it, and Sk�lafell to her left. Next she drove past the turning to Vind�shl�d where she had once spent a two-week summer holiday as a child. She followed the red tail lights at a comfortable speed until they drove down through the Kerlingarhraun lava field, and there their ways parted. The red lights accelerated and disappeared into the darkness. She wondered if they were heading for the pass at Uxahryggir and north over the Kaldidalur mountain road. She had often taken that route herself. It was a beautiful drive down the Lundarreykjadalur valley to Borgarfj�rdur fjord. The memory of a lovely summer&#x2019;s day once spent at Lake Sandkluftavatn came back to her.</p><p>Karen herself turned right and drove on into the blackness of the Thingvellir national park. She had difficulty identifying the landmarks in the gloom. Should she have turned off sooner? Was this the right turning down to the lake? Or was it the next? Had she come too far?</p><p>Twice she went wrong and had to turn round. It was a Thursday evening and most of the cottages were empty. She had brought along a supply of food and reading material, and Mar�a had told her that they had recently installed a television in the cottage. But Karen&#x2019;s main intention was to try to sleep, to get some rest. The bank was like a madhouse after the recent abortive takeover. She had reached the point where she could no longer make any sense of the infighting between the different factions among the major shareholders. Press releases were issued at two-hourly intervals and, to make matters worse, it transpired that a severance payment of a hundred million kr�nur had been promised to one of the bank&#x2019;s partners, someone whom a particular faction wanted to fire. The board had succeeded in stirring up public outrage, and it was Karen&#x2019;s job to smooth things over. It had been like this for weeks now and she was at the end of her tether by the time it occurred to her to escape from town. Mar�a had often offered to lend her the cottage for a few days, so Karen decided to give her a call. &#x2018;Of course,&#x2019; Mar�a had said at once.</p><p>Karen made her way slowly along a primitive track through low-growing scrub until her headlights lit up the cottage down by the water. Mar�a had given her a key and told her where they kept a spare. It was sometimes useful to have an extra key hidden at the cottage.</p><p>She was looking forward to waking up tomorrow morning amidst the autumn colours of Thingvellir. For as long as she could remember people had flocked to the national park in the autumn, since few places in the country could boast such a brilliant display of colour as here by the lake where the rust-red and orange shades of the dying leaves extended as far as the eye could see.</p><p>She started to ferry her luggage from the car to the sun deck beside the door. Then, putting the key in the lock, she opened the door and groped for the light switch. The light came on in the hallway leading to the kitchen and she took her little suitcase inside and placed it in the master bedroom. To her surprise, the bed was unmade. That was not like Mar�a. A towel was lying on the floor of the lavatory. When she turned on the light in the kitchen she became aware of a strange presence. Although she was not afraid of the dark, she felt a sudden sensation of physical unease. The living room was in darkness. By daylight there was a superb view of the lake from its windows.</p><p>Karen turned on the living-room light.</p><p>Four solid beams extended across the ceiling, and from one of them a body was hanging, its back turned to her.</p><p>Shock sent her crashing back against the wall and her head slammed into the wood panelling. Everything went black. The body hung from the beam by a thin blue cord, mirrored in the dark living-room window. She didn&#x2019;t know how long it was before she dared to inch closer.

The samplers shown here, which include both Quaker and Shaker examples, are organized by state within each century, and the author successfully accomplishes her goal of facilitating their identification and classification. Often, books on samplers provide only a description of the piece. But, like Betty Ring's Let Virtue Be a Guide to Thee: Needlework in the Education of Rhode Island Women, 1730-1830 (Rhode Island Historical Soc., 1983), this work relies on exhaustive research in an effort to identify the schoolmistress, school locations, historical influences, patterns, and verse of the various samplers.

Some reviewers call <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> the best reference work on animals ever published. Others call it the legacy left to us by famed zoologist and animal lover, Bernhard Grzimek. The accolades and praise go on for the newest addition to Gales line of reference titles. The original 13-vol. set, published in Germany in the late 1960s, is internationally renowned for its scientific reporting, coverage and illustrations, and serves as a major point of reference for researchers and students studying the animal kingdom. Thorough articles familiarize readers with animals found everywhere on the globe, detailing their life cycles, predators, food systems, overall ecology and much more. Staying true to the original scientific pedigree, Gale enlisted prominent advisors and contributors from the international scientific community to incorporate recent developments in the animal world. Our new editions of <em>Grzimeks Animal Life Encyclopedia</em> are sure to serve the needs of students at every academic level.</p></p><p>The final volumes of the massive revised <i>Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia</i> have finally rolled off the press. We reviewed volumes 8 to 11 (<i>Birds</i>) in the January 1 &amp; 15, 2003, issue, and volumes 4 and 5 (<i>fishes</i>), volume 6 (<i>amphibians</i>), and volume 7 (<i>reptiles</i>) in the December 1, 2003, issue. Volume 17 is a comprehensive index. <p>H. C. Bernhard Grzimek hoped his original encyclopedia would "disseminate knowledge of the animals and love for them." This is also a goal of the revised edition; it does not disappoint. All volumes follow a similar organization. Introductory chapters, written in a narrative style, are usually followed by taxonomic chapters and species accounts, which follow a prescribed format. There are no page references from the main account of the species to the illustrations; the index at the end of each volume must be consulted. Color photographs, illustrations, and distribution maps supplement the text. Additional resources include references to books, periodical articles, organizations, and Web sites.</p><p>Volume 1, <i>Lower Metazoans and Lesser Deuterostomes</i> (e.g., sea anemones, sponges, jellyfish, flukes, tapeworms, nematodes), and volume 2, <i>Protostomes</i> (e.g., mollusks, gastropods, annelids), represent animals often not well known to nonspecialists. The authors do an excellent job of presenting current research and scientific facts in combination with interesting sidelights. Volume 3, <i>Insects</i>, is written in an engaging style and provides a good overview of more than 1.5 million known species. Volumes 12-16, <i>Mammals</i>, are a rich source of information on this popular group, from platypuses to moles to bats to wildebeests to whales to humans. The illustrations are of mixed appeal; some look like strained imitations of reality, while others seem as if the animals could walk off the page. A less current revision is McGraw-Hill's 1990 <i>Grzimek's Encyclopedia of Mammals</i>, distinguished by exceptional large-format action photographs.</p><p>Authoritative writing in a style accessible to the general reader, comprehensive coverage, a taxonomic arrangement to facilitate comparison between species, consistent organization, ample color illustrations and photographs, incorporation of current research, and the inclusion of conservation status and the significance of the animal to humans make <i>Grzimek's</i> an excellent choice for academic, large public, and special libraries. <i>RBB</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

It is fondly remembered as a time when cheering crowds filled the streets, danced, drank and made love until the small hours. These images of victory and celebration are so strong in our minds that the period of anarchy and civil war that followed has been forgotten.&nbsp; Across Europe, landscapes had been ravaged, entire cities razed and more than thirty million people had been killed in the war. The institutions that we now take for granted-such as the police, the media, transport, local and national government-were either entirely absent or hopelessly compromised. Crime rates were soaring, economies collapsing, and the European population was hovering on the brink of starvation.&nbsp; In Savage Continent, Keith Lowe describes a continent still racked by violence, where large sections of the population had yet to accept that the war was over.&nbsp; Individuals, communities and sometimes whole nations sought vengeance for the wrongs that had been done to them during the war. Germans and collaborators everywhere were rounded up, tormented and summarily executed. Concentration camps were reopened and filled with new victims who were tortured and starved.&nbsp; Violent anti-Semitism was reborn, sparking murders and new pogroms across Europe.&nbsp; Massacres were an integral part of the chaos and in some places-particularly Greece, Yugoslavia and Poland, as well as parts of Italy and France-they led to brutal civil wars. In some of the greatest acts of ethnic cleansing the world has ever seen, tens of millions were expelled from their ancestral homelands, often with the implicit blessing of the Allied authorities. Savage Continent is the story of post WWII Europe, in all its ugly detail, from the end of the war right up until the establishment of an uneasy stability across Europe toward the end of the 1940s. Based principally on primary sources from a dozen countries, Savage Continent is a frightening and thrilling chronicle of a world gone mad, the standard history of post WWII Europe for years to come.</p><p>Keith Lowe is the author of two novels, Tunnel Vision and New Free Chocolate Sex , and the critically acclaimed history Inferno: The Fiery Devastation of Hamburg, 1943.<br><br>John Lee has read audiobooks in almost every conceivable genre, from Charles Dickens to Patrick O'Brian, and from the very real life of Napoleon to the entirely imagined lives of sorcerers and swashbucklers.

What greeted me instead was the lingering stench of ashes and the empty sockets of our ruined home.</i> Samuel Puterman on his return to Warsaw, 19451;2 <br>&nbsp; <i>We could see the physical destruction but the effect of vast economic disruption and political, social, and psychological destruction ... completely escaped us.</i> Dean Acheson, US Under-Secretary of State, 1947 1 Physical Destruction In 1943 the travel book publisher Karl Baedeker produced a guide to the Generalgouvernement -- that part of central and southern Poland that remained nominally separate from the Reich. As with all publications in Germany at the time, it was just as concerned with disseminating propaganda as with giving its readers information. The section on Warsaw was a case in point. The book waxed lyrical about the city's German origins, its German character and the way that it had become one of the world's great capitals 'predominantly through the effort of Germans'. It urged tourists to visit the medieval Royal Castle, the fourteenth-century cathedral and the beautiful late-Renaissance Jesuit Church - all the products of German culture and influence. Of special interest was the complex of late baroque palaces around Pilsudski Square - 'the most beautiful square in Warsaw' - now renamed Adolf Hitler Platz. The centrepiece was the 'Saxon' Palace, built of course by a German, and its beautiful Saxon Gardens, which were again designed by German architects. The travel guide conceded that one or two buildings had unfortunately been damaged by the battle for Warsaw in 1939, but since then, it reassured its readers, Warsaw 'is being rebuilt once more under German leadership'.1 No mention was made of the western suburbs of the city, which had been converted into a ghetto for Jews. This was probably just as well because even as the book was being published an uprising broke out here, obliging SS-Brigadef�hrer J�rgen Stroop to set fire to virtually every house in the district.2 Almost four square kilometres of the city were entirely destroyed in this way. The following year a second uprising broke out throughout the rest of the city. This time it was a more general insurgency inspired by the Polish Home Army. In August 1944, groups of Polish men, women and teenagers began ambushing German soldiers and stealing their weapons and ammunition. For the next two months they barricaded themselves in and around the Old City, and held down more than 17,000 German anti-insurgent troops.3 The uprising only came to an end in October after some of the most brutal fighting of the war. Afterwards, tired of Polish disobedience, and aware that the Russians were about to enter the city anyway, Hitler ordered the city to be completely razed.4 Accordingly, German troops blew up the medieval Royal Castle that had so impressed Baedeker. They undermined the fourteenth-century cathedral and blew that up too. Then they destroyed the Jesuit Church. The Saxon Palace was systematically blown up over the course of three days just after Christmas 1944, as was the entire complex of baroque and rococo palaces. The European Hotel, recommended by Baedeker, was first burned down in October and then, just to make sure, blown up in January 1945. German troops went from house to house, street to street, systematically destroying the entire city: 93 per cent of Warsaw's dwellings were destroyed or damaged beyond repair. To complete the destruction they burned down the National Archive, the Archives of Ancient Documents, the Financial Archives, the Municipal Archives, the Archives of New Documents and the Public Library.5 After the war, when the Poles were turning their thoughts to rebuilding their capital, the National Museum held an exhibition showing fragments of buildings and artworks that had been damaged or destroyed during the German occupation. They produced an accompanying guide book, which, unlike Baedeker's guide book, was written entirely in the past tense. The intention was to remind the people of Warsaw, and the wider world, of exactly what had been lost. There is a realization implicit in both the guide book and the exhibition itself that those who lived through the destruction of Warsaw were no longer able to appreciate the immensity of what had happened to their city. For them it had happened gradually, beginning with the bombardment in 1939, continuing with German looting during the occupation and ending with the destruction of the Ghetto in 1943 and the final devastation in late 1944. Now, just a few months after their liberation, they had become used to living in shells of houses, surrounded on all sides by mountains of rubble.6 In some ways the true scale of the destruction could be appreciated only by those who saw its results without actually witnessing it taking place. John Vachon was a young photographer who came to Warsaw as part of the United Nations relief effort after the war. The letters he wrote to his wife Penny in January 1946 display his complete incomprehension at the scale of the destruction. <br> This is really an incredible city and I want to give you an idea of it, and don't know how I can do it. It's a big city, see. Over one million pre war. Big as Detroit. Now it is 90 per cent <i>all</i> destroyed ... Wherever you walk here it is hunks of buildings standing up without roofs or much sides, and people living in them. Except the Ghetto, where it is just a great plain of bricks, with twisted beds and bath tubs and sofas, pictures in frames, trunks, millions of things sticking out among the bricks. I can't understand how it could have been done ... It's something that's so vicious I can't believe it.7 <br> The beautiful baroque city described by Karl Baedeker just two years earlier had completely disappeared. <br>&nbsp; It is difficult to convey in meaningful terms the scale of the wreckage caused by the Second World War. Warsaw was just one example of a city destroyed - there were dozens more within Poland alone. In Europe as a whole <i>hundreds</i> of cities had been entirely or partially devastated. Photographs taken after the war can give some idea of the scale of the destruction of individual cities, but when one tries to multiply this devastation across the entire continent it necessarily defies comprehension. In some countries - especially Germany, Poland, Yugoslavia and Ukraine - a millennium of culture and architecture had been crushed in the space of just a few short years. The violence that brought about such total devastation has been likened by more than one historian to Armageddon. 8 Those people who witnessed the wreckage of Europe's cities struggled to come to terms even with the local devastation they saw, and it is only in their tortured, inadequate descriptions that some of the destruction becomes imaginable. However, before we come to such human reactions to the crushed and shattered scenery, it is necessary to set down some statistics - because statistics matter, regardless of how elusive they can be. As the only nation to have successfully defied Hitler for the entire duration of the war, Britain had suffered badly. The Luftwaffe had dropped almost 50,000 tons of bombs on Britain during the Blitz, destroying 202,000 houses and damaging 4.5 million more.9 The pounding received by Britain's major cities is well known, but it is what happened to some of the smaller towns that shows the true extent of the bombing. The ferocity of the attacks on Coventry gave birth to a new German verb, <i>coventriren</i> -- to 'Coventrate', or destroy utterly. Clydebank is a relatively small industrial town on the outskirts of Glasgow: out of 12,000 homes only 8 escaped damage.10 Across the English Channel the damage was not quite so universal, but much more concentrated. Caen, for example, was virtually wiped off the map when the Allies landed in Normandy in 1944: 75 per cent of the city was obliterated by Allied bombs.11 Saint-L� and Le Havre suffered even worse, with 77 per cent and 82 per cent of the buildings destroyed.12 When the Allies landed in the south of France more than 14,000 buildings in Marseilles were partly or completely destroyed.13 According to government records for compensation claims and loans for war losses, 460,000 buildings in France were destroyed in the war, and a further 1.9 million damaged.14 The further east one travelled after the war, the worse the devastation became. In Budapest 84 per cent of the buildings were damaged, and 30 per cent of them so badly that they were entirely uninhabitable.15 About 80 per cent of the city of Minsk in Belarus was destroyed: only 19 of 332 major factories in the city survived, and only then because mines set by the retreating Germans were defused by Red Army sappers just in time.16 Most of the public buildings in Kiev were mined when the Soviets retreated in 1941 -- the rest were destroyed when they returned in 1944. Kharkov in eastern Ukraine was fought over so many times that eventually there was little left to dispute. In Rostov and Voronezh, according to one British journalist, 'the destruction was very nearly 100 per cent'.17 And the list goes on. Approximately 1,700 towns and cities were devastated in the USSR, 714 of them in Ukraine alone.18 Those who travelled across this ruined landscape in the aftermath of the war saw city after city after city destroyed. Very few of these people ever attempted to describe the totality of what they had seen - instead they struggled to come to terms with the more localized damage in each single city as they came across it. Stalingrad, for example, was nothing but 'lumps of walls, boxes of half-ruined buildings, piles of rubble, isolated chimneys'.19 Sebastopol 'was now melancholy beyond words' where 'even in the suburbs ... there was hardly a house standing'.20 In September 1945 the American diplomat George F. Kennan found himself in the formerly Finnish but now Russian city of Vyborg, admiring the way that 'Rays of early morning sunshine ... caught the gutted shells of apartment buildings, and flooded them momentarily with a chill, pale gleam.' Apart from a goat that he startled in one of the ruined doorways, Kennan seemed to be the only living being in the entire city.21 At the centre of all this destruction lay Germany, whose cities undoubtedly suffered the most comprehensive damage of the war. Around 3.6 million German apartments were destroyed by the British and American air forces - that is, about a fifth of all living spaces in the country.22 In absolute terms the damage to living spaces in Germany was nearly eighteen times as bad as it was in Britain.23 Individual cities suffered far worse than the average. According to figures from the Reich's Statistical Office, Berlin lost up to 50 per cent of its habitable premises, Hanover 51.6 per cent, Hamburg 53.3 per cent, Duisburg 64 per cent, Dortmund 66 per cent, and Cologne 70 per cent.24 When Allied observers came to Germany after the war, most of them expected to find destruction on the same scale as they had witnessed in Britain during the Blitz. Even after British and American newspapers and magazines began to print pictures and descriptions of the devastation it was impossible to prepare for the sight of the real thing. Austin Robinson, for example, was sent to western Germany directly after the war on behalf of the British Ministry of Production. His description of Mainz while he was there displays his sense of shock: <br> That skeleton, with whole blocks level, huge areas with nothing but walls standing, factories almost completely gutted, was a picture that I know will live with me for life. One had known it intellectually without feeling it emotionally or humanly.25 <br> British Lieutenant Philip Dark was equally appalled by the apocalyptic vision he saw in Hamburg at the end of the war: <br> [W]e swung in towards the centre and started to enter a city devastated beyond all comprehension. It was more than appalling. As far as the eye could see, square mile after square mile of empty shells of buildings with twisted girders scarecrowed in the air, radiators of a flat jutting out from a shaft of a still-standing wall, like a crucified pterodactyl skeleton. Horrible, hideous shapes of chimneys sprouting from the frame of a wall. The whole pervaded by an atmosphere of ageless quiet ... Such impressions are incomprehensible unless seen.26 <br> There is a sense of utter despair in many of the descriptions of German cities in 1945. Dresden, for example, no longer resembled 'Florence on the Elbe' but was more like 'the face of the moon', and planning directors believed that it would take 'at least seventy years' to rebuild.27 Munich was so badly devastated that 'It truly did almost make one think that a Last Judgement was imminent.'28 Berlin was 'completely shattered - just piles of rubble and skeleton houses'.29 Cologne was a city 'recumbent, without beauty, shapeless in the rubble and loneliness of complete physical defeat'.30 Between 18 and 20 million German people were rendered homeless by the destruction of their cities - that is the same as the combined prewar populations of Holland, Belgium and Luxembourg.31 Another 10 million people in Ukraine were also homeless, or more than the total prewar population of Hungary.32 These people lived in cellars, ruins, holes in the ground - anywhere they could find a modicum of shelter. They were entirely deprived of essential services, such as water, gas, electricity - as were millions of others across Europe. Warsaw, for example, had just two working street lights.33 In Odessa water was only available from artesian wells, so that even visiting dignitaries were given just a single bottle per day for washing.34 Without these essential utilities the populations of Europe's cities were reduced to living, as one American columnist described it, 'in medieval fashion surrounded by the broken-down machinery of the twentieth century'.35 <br>&nbsp; While the devastation was at its most dramatic in Europe's cities, rural communities often suffered just as badly. Across the continent farms were plundered, burned, flooded or simply neglected because of the war. The marshes in southern Italy, so assiduously drained by Mussolini, were deliberately flooded again by the retreating Germans, causing a resurgence of malaria.36 More than half a million acres of Holland (219,000 hectares) were ruined when German troops deliberately opened the dykes that kept the sea at bay.37 Remoteness from the main theatres of war was no protection from such treatment. More than a third of the dwelling places in Lapland were destroyed by the retreating Germans.38 The idea was to deny the turncoat Finnish forces any shelter during the winter, but it also had the effect of creating over 80,000 refugees. Across northern Norway and Finland roads were mined, telephone lines pulled down and bridges blown up, creating problems that would be felt for years after the war was over. Once again, the further east, the worse the destruction. Greece lost a third of its forests during the German occupation, and over a thousand villages were burned and left uninhabited.39 In Yugoslavia, according to the postwar Reparations Commission, 24 per cent of the orchards were destroyed, as were 38 per cent of the vineyards and about 60 per cent of all livestock. The plundering of millions of tons of grain, milk and wool completed the ruination of the Yugoslav rural economy.40 In the USSR it was even worse: here as many as 70,000 villages were destroyed, along with their communities and the entire rural infrastructure.41 Such damage was not merely the result of fighting and casual plundering - it was caused by the systematic and deliberate destruction of land and proper...</p><h2>Women, Art, and Power: And Other Essays (Icon Editions)</h2><p>Women, art, and power: And other essays (Icon editions) [Jan 01, 1988] Nochlin, Linda</p><p><b>Linda Nochlin</b> is Distinguished Professor of Art History at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York.

The Indians, forerunners of those known to whites as the Seminoles, came down the peninsula to the Glades and lived apart in the grassy hammocks, on the beaches at the mouth, or on the rocky rims of the stone trough that holds the river of grass. Although the early Spaniards conquered other Floridian Indians by the sword or the Cross, the natives of the Glades, independent, suspicious, self-sufficient, were unconquerable. Eventually, of course, more white men came and set up cities on the edges of the Everglades. But despite the civilization so near at hand, the interior of the saw-grass river region is still wild and natural, much of it as yet uncharted.</p><p>Originally published in 1947, <i>The Everglades</i> was one of those rare books, like <i>Uncle Tom's Cabin</i> and <i>Silent Spring</i>, to have an immediate political effect: it helped draw public attention to a vast and little-known area that South Florida developers had deemed a worthless swamp and were busily draining, damming, and remaking, and it mustered needed public support for President Harry Truman's controversial order, later that year, to protect more than 2 million acres as Everglades National Park.<p> Remote and seldom visited, the Everglades nonetheless had a rich human history: several Native American peoples, Spanish explorers, French and English pirates, runaway slaves, and Anglo trappers and fishermen all came to this limestone basin and made their lives among its slowly moving water and fast-growing sawgrass. It is this human history, more than the life histories of the Everglades' deer, panthers, scorpions, serpents, and alligators, that occupies most of Marjorie Stoneman Douglas's pages; even so, her lyrical if sometimes sentimental account of the area's flora and fauna makes for fine reading.</p><p> Douglas died in 1998 at the age of 107, having done more than any other one person to protect this magnificent portion of wild America. Anyone wishing to continue her good work--and to understand the Everglades' importance in the shape of things--will find great riches in her book. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Marjory Stoneman Douglas is considered by many to be the first lady of the Everglades. What others called a worthless swamp, she dubbed the &#x201c;river of grass,&#x201d; and she fought fiercely to protect and revive the Everglades in her lifetime. Her autobiography, Marjorie Stoneman Douglas: Voice of the River, is the story of a strong-willed, determined woman who let nothing stand in the way of accomplishing her goals and living &#x201c;my own life in my own way.&#x201d; Everglades: River of Grass chronicles her involvement in Everglades affairs.</p><h2>Pricksongs &amp; Descants: Fictions</h2><p>Pricksongs &amp; Descants, originally published in 1969, is a virtuoso performance that established its author - already a William Faulkner Award winner for his first novel - as a writer of enduring power and unquestionable brilliance, a promise he has fulfilled over a stellar career. It also began Coover's now-trademark riffs on fairy tales and bedtime stories. In these riotously word-drunk fictional romps, two children follow an old man into the woods, trailing bread crumbs behind and edging helplessly toward a sinister end that never comes; a husband walks toward the bed where his wife awaits his caresses, but by the time he arrives she's been dead three weeks and detectives are pounding down the door; a teenaged babysitter's evening becomes a kaleidoscope of dangerous erotic fantasies-her employer's, her boyfriend's, her own; an aging, humble carpenter marries a beautiful but frigid woman, and after he's waited weeks to consummate their union she announces that God has made her pregnant. Now available in a Grove paperback, Pricksongs &amp; Descants is a cornerstone of Robert Coover's remarkable career and a brilliant work by a major American writer.<br></p><p></p><h2>Illustrated Study Bible for Kids: Holman Christian Standard Bible</h2><p><p>Available in Hardcover.<br><br>The popular <b><i>Illustrated Study Bible for Kids </i></b>presents a fresh, colorful, and exciting approach to Bible study, unlike any other.

Includes a chapter on each of the fifteen Mysteries, examining them from archaeological, anthropological, textual, and other viewpoints, and a thorough explanation of the many promises conveyed by apparitions of Mary to St. Dominic and Bl. Alan de Rupe, drawn largely from the Fathers of the Church. Throughout the text, the immense spiritual and social benefits of the Rosary and of meditative prayer emerge through the stories of the great saints who re-converted England, France, Italy, and other countries by encouraging the practice.</p><p>By the author of the best-selling Why Do Catholics Do That?, this book presents an encyclopedic range of answers to the most commonly asked questions about the Rosary and the other devotional practices to which it is related, such as: Exactly what is prayer, and how does it work? How does Judeo-Christian meditation differ from Oriental practices? Why are the beads so important? How does the Rosary relate to the Bible? Doesn&#39;t Mt 6:7 prohibit repetition of prayers? Why pray to Mary in the first place? What part does Mary play in Christian concepts of salvation? Why do modern apparitions of Mary always urge people to pray the Rosary? And many, many more. In addition, the book offers powerful examinations of those episodes in Christ&#39;s life-the &#34;Mysteries&#34;-that the Rosary targets as the subjects of meditation, including the Annunciation, the Nativity, the Resurrection, and twelve others. Having read Johnson&#39;s compelling account of the Crucifixion-the most intense to appear in living memory-you&#39;ll never see a crucifix in the same way again."A great book on the Rosary by that great writer on Catholic mysticism, Kevin Orlin Johnson . . .

Box is the winner of the Anthony Award, Prix Calibre 38 (France), the Macavity Award, the Gumshoe Award, the Barry Award, and is an Edgar Award and L.A. Times Book Prize finalist. He lives in Wyoming.1<p>Fort Smith, Montana</p><p>Nate Romanowski pushed the drift boat onto the Bighorn River at three-thirty in the morning on a Sunday in early October and let the silent muscle of the current pull him away from the grassy bank. Eight miles downriver was the fortified and opulent vacation home of the notorious man he was going to kill.</p><p>It was twenty-four degrees and steam rose from the surface of the black water in thick tendrils, and he was soon enveloped in it. The craft f loated quietly and he manned the long oars to keep the up- swept bow pointing forward. Gnarled walls of river cottonwoods closed him in, their bare branches reaching overhead from both banks as if to try and join hands. For ten minutes between Third Island and Dag&#x2019;s Run, he couldn&#x2019;t see a damned thing and operated exclusively on feel and sound and experience. He kept to the main channel and avoided the shallows so he wouldn&#x2019;t scrape bottom and could f loat as swiftly as possible.</p><p>He&#x2019;d made the run before in preparation&#x2014;so many times, in fact, that the rhythm, mood, and temperament of the river was as famil- iar to him as his falcons, his weapons, and his code. Or what was left of his code, anyway, he thought, and grinned bitterly to himself in the dark.</p><p>While doing night reconnaissance, he&#x2019;d worn the narrow com- pression pack on his back that he wore now, and he was so used to the dead weight of the gear inside that he almost forgot it was there. His .500 Wyoming Express five-shot revolver, the most powerful handgun on earth, hung grip-out from its shoulder holster below his left ribs, its security tether unsnapped.</p><p>Over his shoulder, the massive concrete spillway of the Yellowtail Dam glowed light blue in the muted light of the stars and the scythe- like slice of moon. A single cumulus cloud, its rounded edges high- lighted by starlight, moved from north to south, blotting out the continuity of the brilliant Milky Way. It would be hours before f ly- fishing guides and anglers&#x2014;men, women, but mostly men&#x2014;arrived at the launch near the dam and started their half-day or daylong drift f loats down the legendary Bighorn. Nate slipped a cell phone from his breast pocket and powered it on. When he had a signal and the screen glowed, he called up the only number stored in it and texted: <i>It&#x2019;s a go. </i>And sent the message.</p><p>Within a minute, there was a response: <i>Go do some good.</i></p><p>Nate turned off the phone and slipped it back into his pocket.</p><p>Nat e wa s ta l l , angular, and rangy. He didn&#x2019;t row with the oars but used them to steer the boat by lowering one or the other into the current to bring the bow around. He had worked on his technique so it was smooth and he wouldn&#x2019;t splash. The oars were an extension of his arms, and his movements were smooth and unhurried.</p><p>His friend Joe Pickett had once described his face and eyes as &#x201c;hawklike.&#x201d; His blond ponytail, constrained by leather falcon jesses, had grown to midway between his shoulders. It was tucked into the collar of his tactical sweater so it wouldn&#x2019;t be noticed. His eyes were blue and piercing, and the planes of his face were f lat, severe, and aerodynamic. He wore a dark camo slouch hat, and his sharp cheek- bones were darkened with soot so the moonlight, such as it was, wouldn&#x2019;t ref lect.</p><p>Th er e wa s no dou bt, Nate had been told, that the world would be a better place without Henry P. Scoggins III in it.</p><p>Scoggins was short, f leshy, stooped, and walleyed, and was the last direct heir of the Scoggins pharmaceutical empire of Newark, New Jersey. Unlike his grandfather, the senator and ambassador, or his father, the well-intentioned philanthropist, Henry the Third, as he was known, used his billions to manipulate monetary currencies around the world, corner the market on fourteen of seventeen rare earth metals, and lavishly fund activist groups that advocated legal- ized prostitution, drug use, and polygamy. He enjoyed the company of corrupt machine politicians, gangsta rap artists, foreign dictators, and domestic organized-crime figures. Several of his lurid divorce proceedings were front-page news over the years, as well as the Los Angeles murder trial where he&#x2019;d been accused of shooting a hooker in the face and killing her on the front porch of his mansion. He had been found innocent when the jury bought his lawyer&#x2019;s claim that Scoggins mistook her for a homicidal home invader threaten- ing his Beverly Hills neighborhood at the time.</p><p>In video clips, Scoggins spoke in a deliberate mid-register timbre that belied his habit of constantly and furtively looking over the heads of the listeners, as if searching for someone more worth- while, better-looking, or less threatening in the room. He had the arrogant look of a bully who had insulated himself so he&#x2019;d never have to directly confront a challenge, the kind of man comfortable with rewarding his friends in person and punishing his enemies from a distance.</p><p>Isolating the man was the problem. Scoggins surrounded himself with armed bodyguards, and his five U.S.-based homes&#x2014;Newark, Manhattan, Aspen, Palm Beach, and the infamous Beverly Hills manse&#x2014;were set up with elaborate security systems. His overseas properties in Caracas, Abu Dhabi, and Grand Cayman were pro- tected by security contractors who were ex&#x2013;Black Ops.</p><p>Few people were aware of the six-million-dollar log home Scog- gins had recently purchased through a holding company on the bank of the Bighorn River. The reason: he wanted to learn to f ly-fish. The rumor was that Scoggins <i>thought </i>he was buying the river itself.</p><p>For t h e pa s t w e ek, in addition to the late-night reconnaissance f loats, Nate had scouted the Scoggins property on the ground by trespassing through an adjoining landholding and avoiding the care- taker. There were very few private residences in the river valley, and the few that were there were massive and expensive. They were ac- cessed by a private road that paralleled the bends of the river. Only a couple of the structures could be seen from the road itself, due to high stone walls and steel security gates. The Scoggins property had not only a swinging gate operated by remote control but also a small guardhouse manned by an armed employee during daylight hours. At night, visitors&#x2014;mostly delivery trucks&#x2014;had to identify them- selves via the closed-circuit camera at the gate to be buzzed in. Ad- ditional closed-circuit cameras that swept the grounds were mounted on poles within the compound, and Nate counted two men&#x2014;one openly armed with a combat shotgun&#x2014;lazily patrolling the grounds. He had dubbed the gate operator Thug Two, and the men on patrol Thug Three and Thug Four. All wore loose-fitting untucked shirts and cargo pants.</p><p>Nate noted the disparity between the massive homes built of logs, stone, and glass, complete with guesthouses and outbuildings and sweeping manicured lawns, and the utter squalor of the Crow Indian Reservation just beyond the fence.</p><p>On Friday he&#x2019;d caught a glimpse of Scoggins in person. He&#x2019;d been glassing the grounds through his spotting scope, memorizing the layout of the buildings and internalizing the contours of the ground, when a thick metal door opened and two women tumbled out. They had long brown legs and jet-black hair and they were wearing only lingerie. As Nate focused in, he felt the hair on the nape of his neck rise. They were Indians, likely Crows from the reservation. They wore too much makeup and they clutched bundles of their clothing under their arms, as if they&#x2019;d been in a hurry to gather it up before they were thrown out of the house. The taller one reminded him of a woman he&#x2019;d once loved named Alisha, who was a Shoshone and a teacher on the Wind River Indian Reservation in Wyoming. It jolted him to his core. She wasn&#x2019;t Alisha but a prostitute, obviously, and she was being unceremoniously kicked out of the house before she could even get dressed.</p><p>The shorter of the two women spun on her heel and shouted some- thing Nate couldn&#x2019;t hear at someone out of view inside the house. The taller woman paused, dropped her head in fear or panic, and reached out to the shorter woman to urge her on.</p><p>Then Scoggins appeared, f lanked by a barrel-chested younger man who had the build of a weight lifter and a smirk on his face. He also wore an oversized shirt and cargo pants. Nate had deemed him Thug One because he rarely left Scoggins&#x2019;s side.</p><p>Scoggins wore a loose-fitting robe and oversized slippers on his feet. Two thin white naked ankles could be seen beneath the hem of the robe. Maybe it was Scoggins&#x2019;s hunched slouch and widespread eyes that, even at that distance, reminded Nate of a toad. He was smirking as well, but also f lipping his fingers at the women, obvi- ously urging them to go away.</p><p>When the shorter woman kept talking and gesticulating and wouldn&#x2019;t leave, Thug One shouldered around Scoggins and rushed her with three long and quick strides. As she turned to run, the big man kicked her hard enough beneath her buttocks to lift her off the ground and send her sprawling. When she scrambled to retrieve the clothes that had f lown into the air, the thug wound up for another kick and the taller hooker yanked the shorter one down the pathway, leaving the clothes strewn on the grass.</p><p>Nate could only guess the cause of the altercation. Maybe the hookers had objected to what they were asked to do, or they&#x2019;d tried and didn&#x2019;t satisfy their customer. Maybe one of them got mouthy or tried to steal something. Or maybe Scoggins decided to throw them out instead of pay them. Nate planned to find out.</p><p>What he did know was that the altercation made his blood boil. It wasn&#x2019;t Alisha, of course, because Alisha had been murdered. A lock of her hair hung from a beaded band on the barrel of his .50 caliber revolver. But she looked like Alisha and it brought back a wave of guilt, shame, and lethal rage. And when the thug kicked the girl hard enough to send her f lying, Nate barely resisted drawing his weapon and charging down the hill to what would likely have been his certain death.</p><p>Later, he watched through his spotting scope as Thug One came back out of the house and gathered the scraps of clothing the prosti- tute had left behind. He walked them over to a trash barrel behind a storage shed and burned them.</p><p>&#x201c;You bastard,&#x201d; Nate whispered.</p><p>He c aught up with the two prostitutes walking up the middle of the narrow two-lane highway in their bare feet. The taller one dan- gled a pair of spike heels from her index finger. The women were cold and disheveled, and when they heard him approach in his rented SUV, they turned and grinned desperately, hoping for a ride. Nate slowed and drove around them and signaled them in.</p><p>&#x201c;Car break down?&#x201d; he asked.</p><p>&#x201c;Something like that,&#x201d; the shorter one said, taking the backseat. &#x201c;You are a sight for sore eyes,&#x201d; the taller one said, jumping up into</p><p>the passenger seat and dropping her shoes on the f loorboard. The interior of his vehicle was suddenly filled with a combination of sweet perfume and musky sweat.</p><p>The short one was named Candy Alexander and the tall one who looked less like Alisha than he thought previously said her name was D. Anita LittleWolf. Both were from Crow Agency on the reserva- tion, but they wanted to get to Hardin to the north because that&#x2019;s where they&#x2019;d left LittleWolf &#x2019;s pickup.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s parked on the side of a bar,&#x201d; LittleWolf said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m really happy you picked us up. Thank you.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes, thank you,&#x201d; Alexander said from the back. He glanced up and saw her dark eyes in the rearview mirror. Streaks of black mas- cara ran down her face from her lashes and she rubbed it clean with the heel of her hand.</p><p>As he drove to Hardin, he made small talk with them about the weather, about fishing, about how odd it was to find two women in their underwear walking up a deserted highway in southern Mon- tana. Although they didn&#x2019;t get specific, they said they&#x2019;d been invited to &#x201c;party down&#x201d; at a big house on the river, but the host had kicked them out and not even offered to drive them back to where they&#x2019;d been picked up. Alexander was still fuming about it, but LittleWolf was serene and seemed to take it in stride.</p><p>&#x201c;So the owner of the house invited you to his place and then kicked you out?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t the owner who took us out there,&#x201d; Alexander said, and described Thug One. &#x201c;We didn&#x2019;t meet the owner until we got there.&#x201d; &#x201c;He said he doesn&#x2019;t like dark meat,&#x201d; LittleWolf said without a hint</p><p>of irony.</p><p>&#x201c;He sounds like a jerk,&#x201d; Nate said.</p><p>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s an asshole,&#x201d; Alexander said, nodding. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re both assholes. I&#x2019;d like to round up some friends of mine and go back there . . .&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Forget about it,&#x201d; LittleWolf said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;d never get in that place again.&#x201d;</p><p>Nate feigned ignorance and asked her why she said that.</p><p>After putting on clothes from overnight bags they&#x2019;d left in their vehicle, LittleWolf and Alexander loosened up over beers in the bar and told Nate about their adventure, from being contacted by Thug One to being met by him at the bar and transported to the big house on the Bighorn River. How the man asked the gate guard to buzz him in. How he punched a keypad on the front door to unlock it. How the owner of the house had come down the staircase and disap- proved of their looks and sent them away, the scene Nate had wit- nessed. Now that they were safe and warm and their pickup was just outside, they laughed about the details. LittleWolf said she was glad they were gone, because the owner of the place gave her the creeps.</p><p>Nate asked them to back up to when they entered the main house. &#x201c;There was a keypad?&#x201d; he asked, and slipped his notebook out</p><p>from his pocket.</p><p>Nate asked D. Anita LittleWolf and Candy Alexander to close their eyes and recall what Thug One had done when he opened the door while it was still very fresh in their memory. LittleWolf said she couldn&#x2019;t see the pad from where she had stood on the porch, but Alexander smiled and described the scene. The keypad was metal and had three rows of numbers: one-two-three on top, four-five-six in the middle, seven-eight-nine on the third row, and a single zero button on the bottom. Nate had sketched out the sequence of the pad on a napkin and handed it over. Alexander closed her eyes in re- call, and punched 4-2-2 and another button in the third row. It was either an eight or a nine, she said. She wasn&#x2019;t sure.</p><p>When Nate asked her how she could recall the sequence, she said she learned it by looking over the shoulders of rubes using the ATM at the convenience store on the reservation across from the Custer Bat- tlefield, where she used to work. Both women collapsed in laughter.</p><p>&#x201c;It eventually got me fired,&#x201d; Alexander squealed. &#x201c;But not before I</p><p>scored a few hundred dollars from <i>turistas</i>.&#x201d;</p><p>Later, after two more rounds, LittleWolf invited him to follow them back to Crow Agency. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got a place where we can party,&#x201d; she said. She looked into his eyes without a hint of guile, and for a moment he saw Alisha again.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have to pass,&#x201d; he said.</p><p>&#x201c;You don&#x2019;t like dark meat, either?&#x201d; Alexander said, teasing him. &#x201c;Actually, I do,&#x201d; Nate said. &#x201c;But I don&#x2019;t like that term. There&#x2019;s no</p><p>dignity in it.&#x201d;</p><p>Chastened, they gathered their purses and shoes. He saw them to their pickup but didn&#x2019;t follo...</p></p><h2>Tarzan, Lord of the Jungle (Tarzan, Book 11)</h2><p>Cruel slave traders had invaded the jungle of Tarzan of the Apes.

By the author of Everyone Dies. 50,000 first printing.</p><p>Michael McGarrity is the author of the Anthony Award&#x2013;nominated <i>Tularosa</i>, as well as <i>Mexican Hat, Serpent Gate, Hermit&#x2019;s Peak, The Judas Judge, Under the Color of Law, The Big Gamble</i>, and <i>Everyone Dies</i>. A former deputy sheriff for Santa Fe County, he established the first Sex Crimes Unit. He has also served as an instructor at the New Mexico Law Enforcement Academy and as an investigator for the New Mexico Public Defender&#x2019;s Office.In McGarrity's latest Kevin Kerney procedural, Kerney, police chief of Santa Fe, N.Mex., is drawn into a messy murder investigation while vacationing at a California ranch. A wealthy hotel magnate, Clifford Spalding, dies of poisoning in the guest room next to Kerney's. Finding himself a suspect, Kerney decides to pursue the case on his own for a few days, uncovering some peculiar circumstances and characters in Spalding's background. They include an unfaithful trophy wife and her shady boyfriend, a deranged and bitter ex-wife and a missing son who presumably died in Vietnam 30 years ago, as well as a couple of police officials who are not as forthcoming as one would expect. Within a few days, Kerney is cleared by California authorities and returns home to more familiar ground. But because of the case's Santa Fe connections, he and his stable of detectives continue the pursuit. As in McGarrity's eight previous Kerney novels (<i>Everyone Dies; </i>etc.), the author excels at detailing police procedures as well as creating a homespun, wry tone that suits setting and characters. His action sequences are shakier, however, and several highly dramatic moments&#x2014;the arrest of the main suspect, her release and eventual capture&#x2014;are flat and hurried. A bit more attention to pacing and momentum could give this appealing series a needed shot of adrenaline. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He won international recognition with his first published title. The Collector (1963), being immediately acclaimed as an outstandingly innovative writer of exceptional imaginative power. This reputation was confirmed with the appearance of his subsequent works, including The Magus (1966) and The French Lieutenant&#39;s Woman (1969). John Fowles died in 2005.In this contemporary, Victorian-style novel Charles Smithson, a nineteenth-century gentleman with glimmerings of twentieth-century perceptions, falls in love with enigmatic Sarah Woodruff, who has been jilted by a French lover. Paul Shelley&#39;s subtle presentation does full justice to Fowles&#39; artful, mysterious tale, whether he&#39;s reading an exposition on Darwinian theory or narration of romantic assignations and broken promises. Never once does he lose the listener as the author moves between the past and present, commenting on Victorian customs, politics and morays. And never once does he give away the novel&#39;s surprise ending. Enthusiastically recommended. R.B.F.

This unique body of detailed design inspiration encompasses the full range of options, from climate, location, and size to surfaces, arrangements, and colors. Whether you&#x2019;re decorating a beach house in Chile or a loft space in Paris, you&#x2019;re sure to be inspired by hundreds of images from around the world&#x2014;a Moroccan house that coolly mixes the modern and traditional in elegant interiors; a dramatic arrangement of shells decorating a tabletop in Mauritius; flowers strewn across bare floorboards for a Christmas feast in Sweden. The enormous range of places here highlight connections and parallels of very different habitats in a way both striking and reassuring. The same attention to detail can clearly inform the layout of a dining room in a modest Mexican home as it does an exclusive club in Buenos Aires. This encyclopedic tome, a sublime visual record of how we construct and adorn our living spaces, celebrates our communal experience of the home.<br><br>From coastal hamlet to urban center, design expert Stafford Cliff compares architectural styles and decorating details from every corner of the world, whether it is a modest adobe dwelling whose contours complement those of the earth or a skyscraper of glass and steel that contrasts the natural terrain. The ingenuity of each culture shines through in the instinctive use of colors and materials, and in the way the spaces are inhabited. <br><br>The world tour of interior design elements and accents is lavishly presented in more than 1,000 glorious color photographs by famed lifestyle photographer Gilles de Chabaneix. Humble yet interesting structures, objects, and settings are all viewed with the same eye as the grandest homes, the rarest antiques, or the most exclusive addresses. From an unadorned Vietnamese sitting room to a bustling Neapolitan street market; a modern London flat to a baroque drawing room in Versailles; an Indian palace to a Chilean caf�, here is a world where old and new, organic and synthetic, happily coexist. And within these interiors, a myriad of choices and inspirations are seen in the contrasts between stark simplicity and sumptuous embellishment, minimal modernism and rococo splendor, the self-consciously urbane and the authentically rustic, the uniform and the eclectic. Fabrics, textures, and ornamental details reflect the complexity of different spaces and lifestyles, spurring countless ideas for personal self-expression. It seems that the way we live is not always defined by where we live.<br><br>Commentary on communal open space, which connects us to one another, and a meticulous guide to sources and materials round out this ultimate treasury. Both beautiful and practical, <b>The Way We Live</b> is much more than a decorating guide&#x2014;it is a design for living.</p><p>STAFFORD CLIFF has both written and designed numerous style books, including<b> Greek Style</b> and <b>Caribbean Style</b>, and was a contributor to Terence Conran&#x2019;s definitive home design guide, <b>The House Book</b>.

The original community was founded in 1814 by the German mystic Father George Rapp, who, with a group of English immigrants, implemented his own theories for a perfect community, this time based on rationalism. Both experiments failed, but Young finds in both a distinctively American yearning for utopia, which continues to characterize the American spirit to this day: a tradition of faith and folly can be traced from Owen's New Moral World to George Bush's New World Order. Written with the same elegance, wit, and lyric beauty that distinguishes her fiction, ?"Angel in the Forest"?was widely praised upon its first publication in 1945. This edition includes Mark Van Doren's introduction to Scribner's 1966 reprint.</p></p><p>Young taught creative writing at Indiana, Iowa, Columbia, Fairleigh Dickinson, and Fordham universities as well as the New School for Social Research.With the extravagance of a poet rather than the pedantry of a historian, Young's long out of print study conjures up the spirit of two failed 19th-century attempts to establish utopias in New Harmony, Ind. The first was the celibate, spiritual society of Father Rapp (1814-1825), the other the rational, socialist order of Robert Owen (1825-1827). Father Rapp presided over a strict, regimented community (dictated by the visitation of an angel), guiding his people to prosperity through the sale of everything from hogs and shoes to gunpowder and whiskey, but creating a repressive regime that required slavish obedience--sexual abstinence was enforced, even when it meant emasculating his own son when that son fathered a child. Owen, by contrast, preached a doctrine of rationality, equality, happiness and social sympathy, that people are not innately sinful but molded by institutions. To put his ideals into practice, he transformed the Scottish mill town of New Lanark according to humanitarian principles, and then purchased New Harmony from Rapp to create a model of socialist perfection--a vain but splendid dream. Young relates all this in a lavish style that evokes the magic and pathos of the experiments. She is a superb storyteller whose allusions, images and digressions are even more telling than the story told. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Audubon&#39;s Birds of America : The Audubon Society Baby Elephant Folio (Tiny Folios)</h2><p>All of John James Audubon&#39;s brilliant bird engravings are graced by illuminating commentary by Roger Tory Peterson, one of America&#39;s best-known ornithologists, in this diminutive, yet lavish volume. 435 engravings. 900 illustrations, over 470 in full color.</p><p><b>Roger Tory Peterson</b> established himself as America&#x2019;s leading ornithologist with his best-selling <i>Field Guide to the Birds</i>. Like Audubon, Peterson received many honorary degrees and awards, including the Presidential Medal of Honor.<br> <br> <b>Virginia Marie Peterson</b> was a scientist and an expert on the environmental effects of oil spills.<br><b>INTRODUCTION</b> <br> <br>Like many another genius, John James Audubon was the right man in the right place at the right time.&#x201d; He came to America with a fresh eye when it was still possible to document some of our unspoiled wilderness. He was also, during his lifetime, witness to the rapid changes that were taking place. Audubon&#x2019;s real contribution was not the conservation ethic but awareness. That in itself is enough; awareness inevitably leads to concern.<br> <br>Audubon&#x2019;s frequent references to the palatability of birds and their availability in the market make us realize how far we have come in bird protection, if not in our epicurean tastes. He wrote that the Barred Owl was very often exposed for sale in the New Orleans market; the Creoles make Gumbo of it, and pronounce the flesh palatable.&#x201d; Not only does he speak with a gourmet&#x2019;s authority about the edibility of owls, loons, cormorants, and crows, but also the gustatory delights of juncos, white-throated sparrows, and robins.<br> <br>It may seem paradoxical that this prototype of the woodsman-huntsman should have become the father figure of the conservation movement in North America. Like most other pioneer ornithologists, he was literally in blood up to his elbows.&#x201d; He seemed obsessed with shooting; far more birds fell to his gun than he needed for drawing or research or for food. He once said that it was not a really good day unless he shot a hundred birds. But in his later writings, when recounting old shooting forays, there is a note of regret, as though his conscience were bothering him about the excesses of his trigger-happy days. He deplored the slaughter, especially when perpetrated by others a double standard, if you will. But only once did he ask forgiveness for his acts. After describing the carnage that took place in the Florida Keys when he and his party landed in a colony of cormorants, committing frightful havoc among them,&#x201d; he wrote: You must try to excuse these murders, which in truth might not have been so numerous had I not thought of you [the reader] quite as often while on the Florida Keys, with the burning sun over my head and my body oozing at every pore, as I do now while peaceably scratching my paper with an iron pen, in one of the comfortable and quite cool houses of Old Scotland.&#x201d;<br> <br>Repeatedly in his writings he reveals this dual nature, or inner conflict. After finding the nest of a pair of least sandpipers he wrote, I was truly sorry to rob them of their eggs, although impelled to do so by the love of science, which offers a convenient excuse for even worse acts.&#x201d; Again, when he first met the arctic tern in the Magdalene Islands: As I admire its easy and graceful motions, I felt agitated with a desire to possess it. Our guns were accordingly charged with mustard-seed shot, and one after another you might have seen the gentle birds come whirling down upon the water Alas, poor things! How well do I remember the pain it gave me, to be thus obliged to pass and execute sentence upon them. At that very moment I thought of those long past times when individuals of my own species were similarly treated; but I excused myself with plea of necessity, as I recharged my double gun.&#x201d; Another example of Audubon&#x2019;s compulsion to shoot.<br> <br>In light of his record it would seem inappropriate that one of the foremost conversation organizations in the United States should adopt Audubon&#x2019;s name, but not so. He was ahead of his time. Like so many thoughtful sportsmen since, he eventually developed a conservation conscience. In an era when there were no game laws, no national parks or refuges, when there was no environmental ethic, when vulnerable nature gave way to human pressures and often sheer stupidity, he was a witness who sounded the alarm. He became more and more concerned during his later travels when, with the perspective of his years, he could see the trend. He noticed that prairie chickens, wild turkeys, Carolina parakeets, and many other birds were no longer as numerous as he once knew them. He wrote vividly and passionately about what he saw. He pondered the future, and some of the passages of his writing were prophetic.<br> <br>Audubon could not have known that because of his artistry and his writing his name would become a household word, synonymous with birds, wildlife, and conservation. The National Audubon Society, formerly known as the National Association of Audubon Societies, was launched in the early years of this century, when no one spoke of ecology&#x201d; or environment.&#x201d; It was primarily a bird organization at first. Over the years the Society has gone through a philosophical metamorphosis. Bird-watching was the precursor of ecological awareness, and Audubon&#x201d; has become a symbol of the environmental movement.<br> <br>John James Audubon received high honors during the two decades prior to his death in 1851, but his greatest fame came in the century that followed. He had sparked a latent nationwide interest in the natural world, especially its birds, and his name became enshrined in hundreds of streets, towns, and parks across the land. Even a mountain peak in the Rockies is named in his honor. In the section of New York City where he lived there is an Audubon Avenue, an Audubon Theatre, an, now translated into digits, an Audubon telephone exchange. There was even a group that called themselves the Audubon Artists,&#x201d; although they did not draw birds. But the greatest monument to his name is the National Audubon Society, which, unlike the Audubon gun clubs&#x201d; before the turn of the century, reflects the other side of John James Audubon, the passionate concern for the survival of wildlife and wild America that he developed as he grew older.<br></p><h2>Columbo: The Hoffa Connection (Harrington&#39;s Series)</h2><p>To find out who killed a Madonna-like superstar and dumped her body in her Beverly Hills swimming pool, the TV detective must unlock the mystery of Jimmy Hoffa&#39;s disappearance twenty years earlier.</p><p>ONE<br>&nbsp;<br>TONIGHT!<br>IN CONCERT!<br>REGINA!<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>An exuberant crowd filled the Hollywood Bowl early, a whole hour before the show was scheduled to begin. The promoters had sold every seat. All day the rumor had circulated that someone had counterfeited thousands of tickets and that some holders of genuine tickets would arrive to find their seats taken. The counterfeit tickets didn't appear, but four thousand people showed up without tickets, na�vely supposing they could buy them at the door. They milled around outside, grumbling. Some of them accosted people approaching the gates with tickets in their hands, offering fifty dollars--even a hundred--for a ticket. A few people with tickets called for bids.<br>A hundred uniformed police officers were on special duty outside and inside. Sergeant Ed Dugan, LAPD, working inside, spotted a fistfight and rushed in to break it up. He separated two young men, one with a bloody nose, and ordered them to sit down and be quiet.<br>"Hey, Sarge, how come you didn't make a collar there?" an officer asked him.<br>"Are you kiddin'?" Dugan replied. "If I made a collar, I'd have to take those guys to the station. Hell, man, whatta ya think? I'd miss the concert!"<br>The officer looked up at the sky. "Well, we got Regina weather," he remarked.<br>The legend was that rain never fell on a Regina concert. Actually, it had rained on the night of a Miami concert--and the night after, too--compelling the promoters to cancel and refund the ticket money because they had booked their megastar for a performance in London the following night. But rain had never postponed a Regina concert in Los Angeles, and never in New York.<br>The sun set. The sky darkened. Then suddenly at 7:30 it was alight again with scores of red, white, and blue laser beams crisscrossing above the Bowl. Instantly a crashing sound filled the Bowl: a computer-generated m�lange of rhythms and tones such as no musical instruments had ever made.<br>Six dancers pranced onto the stage: three male, three female, three black, three white, each with a beautiful physique and a handsome face. The white dancers wore sheer black body stockings, the black dancers white ones. Every feature of their bodies was dimly visible in the low stage lighting and distinctly visible when hit by the brilliant flashes of strobe lights. They danced barefoot, an athletic and acrobatic performance.<br>After two or three minutes the dancers slowed and danced a sinuous and erotic ballet routine. Then the three young women jumped on the men's backs and rode piggyback and giggling as the men trotted offstage.<br>The crowd stood and roared.<br>"AND NOW...LADIES...AND...GENTLEMEN! <i>REGINA</i>!"<br>A thick curtain of smoke rose in front of the stage. A wall of crisscrossed red laser beams formed a backdrop. Strobes flashed on the smoke. The computer-generated cacophony rose to an ear-blasting crescendo, and abruptly the curtain of smoke disappeared, sucked away by powerful fans.<br>Regina stood in the center of the stage. The audience, on its feet, howled, stamped, screeched, whooped, clapped. She smiled and bowed.<br>Regina was a young woman in her late twenties, of medium stature, busty, long-legged, and with a bit of a belly that swelled slightly over the waistband of the black bikini panties that were part of her costume. She wore also a strapless bra, a garter belt that supported fishnet stockings, and shoes with stiletto heels. Her shoulder-length hair was straw blond, bleached to the point of brittleness--it was in face a wig. Her thin, plucked eyebrows were dark brown, as were her eyes. She wore an overall makeup that lightened her skin to almost white, but her lipstick was flaming red.<br>she clutched a wireless microphone in her right hand and belted out her signature opening line:<br>&nbsp;<br>You wouldn't call your crotch va-jeena.<br>So don't call me Ra-jeena.<br>I'm...RAY-GINE-A!<br>An' we're gonna have a <i>hell</i> of a time!<br>Ho-ho!<br>One hell of a, hell of a time!<br>&nbsp;<br>The music erupted into a frenzy, and so did she. She strutted around the stage, singing a song about dancing. The lyrics clearly had two meanings--and the second meaning was not dance, but copulation. Her voice was shrill. She threw her head back and forth, and the hair of her wig swung wildly.<br>The main stage lights dimmed gradually, and more and more Regina was visible only in the sharp bursts of the strobes, which flashed twice a second now. She turned her back, pulled down her bikini panties, and strutted around showing her bare bottom.<br>Her six dancers came onstage again, now in identical bright red leotards cut high on their hips, and backed up her frenetic dancing and singing with a vigorous routine.<br>Regina stalked across the stage, all the while clutching the microphone close to her mouth and muttering, murmuring, or shrieking the lyrics that ranged from risqu� to crude--but remained carefully on the edge of obscene and never crossed that line.<br>She tossed the microphone aside and danced. The backup dancers left her alone on the stage. With the main lights out, she danced in the light of one red strobe. The duration of its flashes diminished. Their frequency increased. It gave her performance the character of a flickering silent movie. Then the intensity diminished. Staring at Regina in the quick, short bursts of strobe light, the audience could not tell for sure whether or not she had lowered her bikini panties and was dancing with her crotch exposed. Most chose to believe she was, and they stood and yelled.<br>They were already happy, and what they had seen was not even half the show. They knew there would be no intermission. A Regina show was nonstop, for two hours and fifteen minutes. Her shows built to a climax, then slacked off a little, then built to another peak. All of them.<br>&nbsp;<br>Copyright � 1995 by MCA Publishing Rights, a Division of MCA, Inc.Having solved the murder of JFK (The Grassy Knoll) and the Tate-LaBianca killings (The Helter Skelter Murders), Lt. Columbo now digs into the mysterious disappearance of Teamsters president Jimmy Hoffa. As in the previous volumes, it's a present-day crime that sets the rumpled L.A. cop on the chase-here, the murder of Regina, a raunchy, Madonna-like rock star. The killing and the killers are shown, just as in the TV episodes; the intrigue comes from seeing how Columbo will solve the case. What might have been a perfect crime goes astray when Regina is accidentally cut as two members of her entourage, acting on orders from a mysterious superior, force the star to stay in her swimming pool at knifepoint until she becomes exhausted and drowns. What follows involves mob conspiracy and counter-conspiracy-and lots of padding and some ludicrous plot twists, with the Hoffa linkage adding next to nothing to the weak and pointless story. To cap it off, Columbo's tried-and-true TV shtick, from the omnipresent cigar to the old raincoat to the verbal mannerisms, just don't work in print. This is one of those books that's worth reading only if your TV set is on the blink. <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Two-Stroke Motorcycle Engine Maintenance and Repair</h2><p><p>Two-Stroke Motrocycle Engine Maintenance and Repair covers the chronological development of two-stroke engines and workshop procedures for each era.

And though many Natives have moved to Alaska&#x2019;s urban areas, each identifies with a different geographic region where their ancestors lived and where their home villages are today.</i><br><i>This book takes a closer look at the rich and diverse cultures of Alaska&#x2019;s various Native groups, and how they continue cultural practices and activities within the context of contemporary society. </i><br> &#x2014;from the Introduction<br> <br>As the first people crossed the Bering Land Bridge into North America, they arrived in what is now called Alaska. Today, many of the descendants of those migrating peoples who stayed in Alaska still live here, speaking their ancestral languages, performing ancestral dances, telling ancestral stories, and following values handed down from generation to generation. Since the short time span of about twenty-seven decades ago when the first Europeans discovered and explored parts of the Alaskan coastline under the command of Vitus Bering, Alaska Natives have met the challenges and solved the problems of today&#x2019;s world while more and more looking within their cultures for solutions.<br>Using updated maps, historical pictures, new contemporary photographs, and updated text, the revised edition of <i>Native Cultures in Alaska: Looking Forward, Looking Back</i> is now available in an elegant and accessible format. We are pleased to publish this work in collaboration with the Alaska Geographic Society.<b>Alaska Geographic</b> is a nonprofit publisher, educator, and supporter of Alaska's parks, forests, and refuges.

The good news of God&#x2019;s loving creation of the world is followed by the bad news that human beings decided to&nbsp; reject the relationship with God and one another for which God created them. The Good News is that God broke into human history in Jesus Christ and made it possible for&nbsp; the members of flawed and fallen humanity to be reconciled to God and hence to one another.</p> <p>Telling that story, living the story, working for the transformation of human lives by the story&#x2013;that, says Robert Tuttle, is what evangelism is all about. In this new history of evangelism, Tuttle introduces the reader to the broad sweep of the church&#x2019;s witness to the gospel. The familiar figures are all here&#x2013;Paul, Patrick, Boniface, Columba, Luther, Wesley, Carey, and the like. Yet Tuttle knows that the story of the church&#x2019;s ministry of evangelism has been a world-wide endeavor, drawing on the talents and commitment of women as well as men, lesser-known figures as well as famous ones. And so this is the first history of evangelism to tell the story from a truly global and inclusive perspective. </p> <p>Tuttle organizes his material into particular historical periods or moments, introducing each one by way of three points of presentation. First, he tells the setting,&nbsp; the various cultural factors (social, political, religious, and the like) relevant to establishing the need for evangelism in that time and place. Next he introduces the speaker,&nbsp; an evangelist uniquely fitted to present the word of the gospel to the time under consideration. Finally he assesses the impact of the speaker and others who ministered in that context.&nbsp; Here he discusses the results of the overall evangelistic effort&#x2015;some well done, some not so well done&#x2015;and points toward the needs and context of the next period.</p></p><p>Robert Tuttle is Professor of Evangelism at Asbury Theological Seminary in Orlando, Florida. He is the author of numerous books, including Can We Talk?, published by Abingdon Press (1999).</p><h2>Silver packages: An Appalachian Christmas story</h2><p>In Appalachia each Christmas, a boy named Frankie waits beside the tracks for the Christmas Train, which will bring presents to the children who live in coal towns and hollows. Year after year, Frankie hopes that one particular gift a very special gift will be tossed to him from that train. It is this enduring hope that will guide him to the true meaning of the season. Full color.</p><p>As a child in West Virginia, Cynthia Rylant never dreamed of becoming a writer. In her free time, she devoured Archie comic books and paperback romances and enjoyed the outdoors. But after taking one college English class, she was, hooked on great writing I didn&#x2019;t know about this part of me until I went to college-didn&#x2019;t know I loved beautiful stories.&#x201d; And one night, inspired by the Southern writer James Agee, she sat down and wrote When I Was Young in the Mountains. Named a Caldecott Honor Book and an ALA Notable Book, it was an instant success.<br><br>Since that night, Rylant hasn&#x2019;t stopped creating wonderful books. Her stories explore friendship, love, grief, and other mysteries, and often draw on her memories of growing up in Appalachia. I get a lot of personal gratification thinking of those people who don&#x2019;t get any attention in the world and making them really valuable in my fiction-making them absolutely shine with their beauty.&#x201d;<br><br>She lives with her many pets in the Pacific Northwest.<br>Grade 1-4. Full-page watercolor paintings decorate this warm, sentimental story loosely based on actual events. Rylant traces the origins of an Appalachian "Christmas Train" that travels through the mountains each year on December 23 to a rich man who wished to repay a debt of kindness he had received many years before. He faithfully returns and tosses silver packages from the caboose to the coal-town children who wait by the tracks. One such child is Frankie, who longs for a doctor's kit every year; instead he gets much-needed socks or mittens along with small toys. As an adult, he moves back to the town to live and work, having fulfilled his dream of becoming a doctor. With her clear, balanced, and well-paced storyteller's voice, the author builds the anticipation and excitement that the children?and especially Frankie?feel at the train's annual arrival. Although the heroic profile of this child-turned-man makes him more of a symbol than a real person, his story is capably told. The illustrations provide panoramic views of the Appalachian countryside, with deep nighttime blues and wintry colors, strengthening the sense of place. A well-rendered reflection on the importance of giving and sharing.<br>Copyright 1997 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>After the Rain</h2><p><p>Phil Broker&#x2019;s latest adventure hits close to home, when he finds his estranged wife and daughter caught in a web of deception that may conceal a terrorist plot to bomb Minneapolis&#x2019;s nuclear power plant</p> <p></p><p>When Phil Broker&#x2019;s estranged wife, Nina, and his daughter, Kit, disappeared months ago, he wasn&#x2019;t surprised. Nina has a mysterious and dangerous job working for the government, and her work has taken her in harm&#x2019;s way before. Broker sets out on a mission to find Nina and force her to choose between life as a soldier or a mother, and take Kit out of danger once and for all.</p><p> At the end of Vapor Trail, Broker learns that Kit has been abandoned by Nina at a motel in Langdon, North Dakota. But when he arrives, the situation is far more complicated than he imagined. Kit is, bizarrely, accompanied by a &#x201c;babysitter&#x201d; named Jane, who claims to be Nina&#x2019;s estranged girlfriend. Buddy Yelton, a local legend and hopeless womanizer, has apparently taken up with Nina. But Buddy Yelton is no harmless local&#x2015;he has hidden connections to the Aryan Nation, and possibly Middle Eastern terrorists as well. And two motel guests are equally mysterious&#x2015;Broker can&#x2019;t help thinking he remembers them as former GIs he knew back in Laos in &#x2019;72. Obviously, all is not as it appears&#x2015;and more than Kit&#x2019;s life is in danger&#x2015;the fate of the entire Minneapolis-St. Paul Metro area is in Broker&#x2019;s hands.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Headlights off, a panel truck drives by moonlight across an open field, following tracks that have been there for decades ...</p><p>Nina Pryce and her husband, Phil Broker, couldn't have more opposite views of the military. Broker's loyalty to the men he served with in Vietnam is matched only by his certainty that they shouldn't have been there in the first place. Nina, though, is a new breed, a decorated and ambitious vet of the first Gulf War. As Nina proceeds along her chosen career path, Broker -- until his recent "retirement," Minnesota's most effective, unorthodox, and controversial undercover cop -- finds himself struggling in the role of patient military spouse.</p><p><em>The driver is a local entrepreneur taking advantage of a decades-old tradition of smuggling and bootlegging by crossing a border too vast and undermanned to be effectively patrolled ... </em></p><p>Incommunicado for months as part of a top-secret Delta anti-terrorist operation, Nina, with daughter Kit in tow, suddenly emerges in Langdon, North Dakota, a town in the heart of the Cold War Minuteman II missile belt. When Broker arrives to take Kit back home, he realizes that the legacy of those warheads still casts a sinister shadow across the desolate north border country, in the person of a damaged psychopath.</p><p><em>Somewhere in the middle of this empty field he will cross, undetected, from one side of the U.S.-Canada divide to the other. He and his cargo -- illegal cigars, whiskey, machine parts, or something much more terrifying -- thus slip undetected across the longest undefended border in the world.</em></p><p>Broker discovers he's been drawn into an elaborate con within a con, made an unwitting participant in a black-bag anti-terrorist detail. But his anger toward Nina for involving him and putting their daughter at risk quickly fades as a larger, more deadly reality becomes evident. With time running out, husband and wife unite with local North Dakota law enforcement to form a last line of defense against a brilliantly simple act of espionage with potentially catastrophic consequences.</p><p>Chuck Logan is the author of eight novels, including <em>After the Rain</em>, <em>Vapor Trail</em>, <em>Absolute Zero</em>, and <em>The Big Law</em>. He is a veteran of the Vietnam War who lives in Stillwater, Minnesota, with his wife and daughter. </p></p><h2>New Clothes for New Year&#39;s Day</h2><p>The New Year is the start of everything new...Follow a young Korean girl as she dresses and prepares for celebrating the Lunar New Year.</p><p>Hyun-Joo Bae graduated from Ehwa Women&#39;s University and studied at the Hankook Illustration School. She is very fond of traditional Korean culture and traditional Korean folktales, and she enjoys working on beautiful and interesting picure books about both.Thoreau may have distrusted enterprises requiring new clothes, but many young children find them thrilling, and they'll connect with the Korean little girl in this imported picture book who dresses up to welcome the new year. Simple words and inventively composed pictures depict each step in donning the elaborate, traditional costume, from the wrapped and tied "rainbow-striped jacket" to the silk pouch that brings good luck. Bae's delicate illustrations move smoothly between depictions of mishaps as the child wrestles with troublesome accessories and grand, wordless portraits, often incorporating traditional furnishings and ornamentation that demonstrate pride in cultural heritage. Despite an awkwardly translated endnote that lacks pronunciations for Korean vocabulary, this makes an inviting addition to lunar New Year offerings, which frequently focus on Chinese celebrations. <i>Jennifer Mattson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

At noon a massive Zulu host attacked the 24th Regiment in its encampment at the foot of the mountain of Isandlwana, a distinctive feature that bore an eerie resemblance to the Sphinx badge of the outnumbered redcoats. Disaster ensued. Later that afternoon the victorious Zulus would strike the tiny British garrison at Rorke&#39;s Drift. How Can Man Die Better is a unique analysis of Isandlwana v of the weapons, tactics, ground, and the intriguing characters who made the key military decisions. Because the fatal loss was so high on the British side there is still much that is unknown about the battle v until now. Mike Snook is the first military professional to scrutinize the battle in print since 1879. He has an unparalleled grasp of the nuances of the ground at Isandlwana and of their implications in practical military terms. Most compellingly he has an instinctive feel for the characters who forged this supremely dramatic history, for this is �family&#39; history v the battle was fought by soldiers of the author&#39;s own regiment. This is a work of unparalleled depth, which eschews the commonly held perception that the British collapse was sudden and that the 24th Regiment was quickly overwhelmed. Rather, there was a protracted and heroic defence against a determined and equally heroic foe. The author reconstructs the final phase of the battle in a way that has never been attempted before. It was to become the stuff of legend, which the author brings to life so vividly that one can almost sense the fear and smell the blood. How Can Man Die Better is essential reading for anyone interested in Isandlwana, the wider Anglo-Zulu War or the Victorian Army.</p><p></p><h2>The Anthology, Part III: Live (Limited Edition)</h2><p><p>Go inside the electric world of Garth Brooks LIVE.

Using sophisticated pop-ups and other three-dimensional devices, the authors show the techniques that go into the creation of a work of art, from color theory to perspective to composition. Thus, art history students who may have been perplexed by descriptions of the theories of art such as the Golden Section dealing with proportion, or Alberti's Renaissance method of rendering perspective, will be enlightened by the various schemes used to explain them here. A few of the contrivances, however, add little (what is the point of the 3-D reproduction of Vermeer's studio that pops up in the first section?). Fitted into the back cover is a pack of postcard-size reproductions of 20 works of art, with a disappointingly shallow audiotape commentary on them. The book's drawbacks are outweighed by the strengths, however. This unique approach to art is so intriguing with its suggestion of inexhaustible treasures that it will be bought by many as gifts for art lovers--and for themselves.

Hammel has written the first comprehensive study of the overall campaign, demonstrating that Guadalcanal was as much a matter of air and surface action as it was a land battle. In the concluding volume of his Guadalcanal trilogy, he maintains that the inability of the Japanese to overcome the Marines' "Cactus Air Force" was the ultimate cause of their defeat; nevertheless, most of the narrative concerns the victory of the U.S. Navy at sea and the awesome confrontations between battleships, cruisers, and destroyers during the climactic three-day battle. Until that turning point in the Pacific war, surface warships of the Navy had lost every engagement with their Japanese counterparts. The victory prevented the Japanese from reinforcing their garrison ashore and at the same time enabled the Americans to augment the precarious foothold established by the Marines. Hammel's description of surface tactics, naval gunnery, and what happens when the order to abandon ship is given is vivid and memorable. Illustrations. <br>Copyright 1988 Reed Business Information, Inc.Guadalcanal was a vicious six-month land-air-sea battle in which both sides suffered appalling losses. Having previously described the air and land battles in the first two parts of his trilogy, Hammel devotes the third volume to an analysis of the events that led to the desperate sea battles of November 13th-15th and the almost miraculous victory of the U.S. Navy. He demonstrates how Japanese tactics and equipment were superior and their troops emotionally prepared for total war, in contrast to American officers. Yet the United States gained a hard-won victory, which determined the future course of the Pacific War. An eminently readable work; for most academic and public libraries.

Translated by Neil Smith.Excerpted from Stalker<br><i>It wasn&#x2019;t until the first body was found that anyone took the video seri�ously. A link to a YouTube video had been sent to the National Crime Unit&#x2019;s public email address. The sender was impossible to trace. The police secretary followed the link, watched the video, assumed it was a rather baffling joke, and entered it in the records.<br></i><br> <i>Two days later three detectives gathered in a small room on the eighth floor of National Crime headquarters in Stockholm, as a result of that very video.<br></i><br> <i>The clip they were watching was only fifty-two seconds long.<br></i><br> <i>The shaky footage, filmed with a handheld camera through a bed�room window, showed a woman in her thirties putting on a pair of black tights.<br></i><br> <i>The three men watched the woman&#x2019;s movements in embarrassed silence.<br></i><br> <i>To get the tights to sit comfortably, she took long strides over imagi�nary obstacles and did several squats.<br></i><br> <i>On Monday morning the woman had been found in the kitchen of a terraced house on the island of Liding�, on the outskirts of Stockholm. She was sitting on the floor with her mouth grotesquely split open. Blood had splattered the window and a white orchid in its flowerpot. She was wearing nothing but a pair of tights and a bra.<br></i><br> <i>The postmortem concluded that she had bled to death as a result of multiple lacerations and stab wounds that were concentrated, in a display of extraordinary brutality, around her throat and face.<br>*<br></i>The word <i>stalker </i>has existed since the early 1700s. In those days it meant a tracker or poacher.<br><br> In 1921 the French psychiatrist de Cl�rambault published what is widely regarded as the first modern analysis of a stalker, a study of a patient suffering from erotomania. Today a stalker is someone who suffers from obsessive fixations, or an unhealthy obsession with monitoring another individual&#x2019;s activities.<br><br> Almost ten percent of the population will be subjected to some form of stalking in the course of their lifetime.<br><br> Most stalkers have or used to have a relationship with the vic�tim. But in a striking number of cases, the fixation is focused on strangers or people in the public eye, and coincidence plays a key role.<br><br> Even though the vast majority of cases never require interven�tion, the police treat the phenomenon seriously because a stalker&#x2019;s pathological obsessiveness brings with it inherent danger. Just as clouds rolling between areas of high and low pressure can turn into a tornado, a stalker&#x2019;s emotional swings between worship and hatred can suddenly become extremely violent.<br><b>1.</b><br>It&#x2019;s a quarter to nine on Friday, August 22. After the magical sunsets and light nights of high summer, darkness is encroaching with surprising speed. It&#x2019;s already dusk outside the National Police Authority.<br><br> Margot Silverman gets out of the elevator and walks toward the security doors in the foyer. She&#x2019;s wearing a black cardigan, a white blouse that fits tightly around her chest, and long black pants whose high waist is stretched across her expanding stomach.<br><br> She ambles toward the revolving doors in the glass wall.<br><br> Margot&#x2019;s hair is the color of polished birch wood and is pulled into a thick braid down her back. She has moist eyes and rosy cheeks. She is thirty-six years old and pregnant with her third child.<br><br> She&#x2019;s heading home after a long week. She&#x2019;s worked overtime every day and has received two warnings for pushing herself too hard.<br><br> She is the new police expert on serial killers, spree killers, and stalkers. The murder of Maria Carlsson is the first case she&#x2019;s been in charge of since her appointment.<br><br> There are no witnesses and no suspects. The victim was single and had no children. She worked as a product adviser for Ikea and had inherited her parents&#x2019; unmortgaged town house after her father died and her mother went into a nursing home.<br><br> On most days, Maria traveled to work with a colleague. They would meet down on Kyrk Road. When she wasn&#x2019;t there that morning, her colleague drove to her house and rang the doorbell, looked through the windows, and then walked around the back and saw her. She was sitting on the floor, her face covered in knife wounds, her neck almost sliced through, her head lolling to one side, and her mouth strangely wide open.<br><br> According to the postmortem, there was evidence to suggest that her mouth had been so arranged after death.<br><br> When Margot was appointed to head the investigation, she knew she couldn&#x2019;t seem too aggressive. She has a tendency to be overeager.<br><br> Her colleagues would have laughed if she&#x2019;d told them she was absolutely convinced that they were dealing with a serial killer.<br><br> Over the course of the week, Margot has watched the video of Maria Carlsson putting her tights on more than two hundred times. All the evidence suggests she was murdered shortly after the recording was uploaded to YouTube.<br><br> Margot can&#x2019;t see anything that makes this video special. It&#x2019;s not unusual for people to have a tights fetish, but nothing about the murder indicates that sort of inclination.<br><br> The video is simply a brief excerpt from an ordinary woman&#x2019;s life. She&#x2019;s single, has a good job, and takes cartoon drawing classes at night.<br><br> There&#x2019;s no way of knowing why the perpetrator was in her gar�den, whether it was pure chance or the result of a carefully planned operation, but in the minutes before the murder, he captured her on video.<br><br> Given that he sent the link to the police, he must have wanted to show them something. He wanted to highlight something about this particular woman, or a certain type of woman. Maybe it&#x2019;s about all women.<br><br> But to Margot&#x2019;s eyes, there&#x2019;s nothing unusual about the woman&#x2019;s behavior or appearance. She&#x2019;s simply concentrating on getting her tights on properly.<br><br> Margot has visited the house on Bredablicks Road twice, but she&#x2019;s spent most of her time examining the video of the crime scene before it was contaminated.<br><br> The perpetrator&#x2019;s film almost looks like a lovingly created work of art compared to the police&#x2019;s crime scene video. The forensics team&#x2019;s minutely detailed recording of the evidence is relentless. The dead woman is filmed from various angles as she sits with her legs stretched out on the floor, surrounded by dark blood. Her bra is in shreds, dangling from one shoulder, and one white breast hangs down toward the bulge of her stomach. There&#x2019;s almost nothing left of her face, just a gaping mouth surrounded by red pulp.<br><br> Margot stops as if by chance beside the fruit bowl, glances over at the guard, who is talking on the phone, then turns her back to him. For a few seconds, she watches the guard&#x2019;s reflection in the glass wall, then takes six apples from the bowl and puts them in her bag.<br><br> Six is too many, she knows that, but she can&#x2019;t stop herself. It&#x2019;s occurred to her that Jenny might like to make an apple pie that evening, with lots of butter, cinnamon, and sugar.<br><br> Her thoughts are interrupted when her phone rings. She looks at the screen and sees a picture of Adam Youssef, a member of the investigating team.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you still in the building?&#x201d; Adam asks. &#x201c;Please tell me you&#x2019;re still here, because we&#x2019;ve&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sitting in the car on Klarastrands Road,&#x201d; Margot lies. &#x201c;What do you need?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;He&#x2019;s uploaded a new video.&#x201d;<br><br> She feels her stomach clench and puts one hand under the heavy bulge. &#x201c;A new video,&#x201d; she repeats.<br><br> &#x201c;Are you coming back?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll stop and turn around,&#x201d; she says, and begins to retrace her steps. &#x201c;Make sure we get a decent copy of the recording.&#x201d;<br><br> Margot could have just gone home, leaving the case in Adam&#x2019;s hands. It would take only a phone call to arrange a full year of paid maternity leave. Her fate is hanging in the balance. She doesn&#x2019;t know what this case will bring, but she can sense its gravity, its dark pull.<br><br> The light in the elevator makes her face seem older in the reflec�tion of the shining doors. The thick, dark line of mascara around her eyes is almost gone. As she leans her head back, she realizes she&#x2019;s starting to look like her father, the former commissioner.<br><br> The elevator stops at the eighth floor, and she walks along the empty hallway as fast as her bulging stomach will allow. She and Adam moved into Joona Linna&#x2019;s old office the same week the police held a memorial service for him. Margot never knew Joona person�ally and had no problem taking over his office.<br><br> &#x201c;You have a fast car,&#x201d; Adam says as she walks in, then smiles, showing his sharp teeth.<br><br> &#x201c;Pretty fast,&#x201d; Margot replies.<br><br> Adam joined the police force after a brief stint as a professional soccer player. He is twenty-eight years old, with long hair and a round youthful face. His short-sleeved shirt is untucked.<br><br> &#x201c;How long has the video been up?&#x201d; she asks.<br><br> &#x201c;Three minutes,&#x201d; Adam says. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s there now. Standing outside the window and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t know that, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;I think he is,&#x201d; he interrupts.<br><br> Margot sets her heavy bag on the floor, sits down on her chair, and calls forensics.<br><br> &#x201c;Margot here. Have you downloaded a copy?&#x201d; she asks. &#x201c;Listen, I need a location or a name. All the resources you&#x2019;ve got. You have five minutes&#x2014;do whatever the hell you want&#x2014;just give me some�thing, and I promise I&#x2019;ll let you go so you can enjoy your Friday evening.&#x201d;<br><br> She puts the phone down and opens the pizza box on Adam&#x2019;s desk. &#x201c;Are you done with this?&#x201d; she asks.<br><br> There&#x2019;s a ping as an email arrives, and Margot quickly stuffs a piece of pizza crust into her mouth. A worry line deepens on her forehead. She clicks on the video file and maximizes the onscreen image, pushes her braid over her shoulder, and rolls her chair back so Adam can see.<br><br> The first shot is an illuminated window shimmering in the darkness. The camera moves slowly closer through leaves that brush the lens.<br><br> Margot feels the hair on her arms stand up.<br><br> A woman is in front of a television, eating ice cream from a carton. She&#x2019;s pulled her sweatpants down and is balancing on one foot. One of her socks is off.<br><br> She glances at the television and smiles at something, then licks the spoon.<br><br> The only sound in police headquarters is the computer fan.<br><br> Just give me one detail to go on, Margot thinks as she looks at the woman&#x2019;s face. Her body seems to be steaming with residual heat. She&#x2019;s just been for a run. The elastic of her underwear is loose after too many washings, and her bra is clearly visible through her sweat-stained shirt.<br><br> Margot leans closer to the screen, her stomach pressing against her thighs, and her heavy braid falls forward over her shoulder.<br><br> &#x201c;One minute to go,&#x201d; Adam says.<br><br> The woman sets the carton of ice cream on the coffee table and leaves the room, her sweatpants still dangling from one foot.<br><br> The camera follows her, moving sideways past a narrow door until it reaches the bedroom window, where the light goes on and the woman comes into view. She kicks her pants off. They fly through the air, hit the wall behind an armchair with a red cushion, and fall to the floor.</p><h2>Star Wars: The Clone Wars - The Wind Raiders Of Taloraan</h2><p>Jedi Knights Anakin and Obi-Wan, with Padawan Ahsoka, travel to the planet Taloraan in hopes of gaining some useful allies for the Republic. But the two ruling groups on the planet are not particularly interested in making a treaty - the Defrandi are already more sympathetic toward the Separatists, and the Wind Raiders are simply unfriendly to everyone!

Noting that Caribbean cuisine has been largely overlooked, she sets out to remedy the matter with hundreds of dishes, many of which are decidedly exotic, with ingredients difficult for non-Caribbean chefs to find. The cassava flour required for Cassava Pie from Bermuda will be easier to locate than the Jamaican fruit, ackee, that figures in Ackee and Saltfish. Also from Jamaica are the more familiar jerk dishes. Other accessible dishes include Corn Fritters from Haiti and Stuffed Baked Red Snapper from Anguilla. Among recipes easier to read than prepare are How to Roast a Pig on a Spit as they do it in Puerto Rico, Round House Flying Fish Pat? from Barbados, Cascadura Matete, which calls for Trinidad's strange mudfish, and Iguana, a Curacao favorite. Along the way, Parkinson provides a brief history of Jamaica's Rastafarian movement, a nonjudgmental look at cockfighting on Guadeloupe and an illustrated essay on the importance of the spice trade to Grenada, which supplies 40% of the world's nutmeg and mace. Cooks with wanderlust will find the breadth of Parkinson's coverage and the many lush photographs entrancing.

Fly-fishers know the importance of imitating the specific life stage that trout are feeding on, however most current flies only imitate size, shape, and color of the natural insect. Soft-hackled nymphs also imitate movement and behavior. Tying &amp; Fishing Soft-Hackled Nymphs explains how to imitate sub-surface aquatic insects using both traditional and modern soft-hackled nymphs and flymphs along with the most effective presentation techniques. By exploring effective thread and translucent fur body material combinations, as well as game-bird hackle collars, these flies take on life-like properties. These patterns can be fished throughout the water column from the stream bottom--to imitate immature nymphal forms--to the surface mimicking transitional emergers.

Tom Rosenstiel is director of the Project for Excellence in Journalism. They are the authors of <b>Warp Speed: America in the Age of Mixed Media</b>.Excerpted from Chapter 1<br><br><b>What Is Journalism For?</b><br><br>On a gray December morning in 1981, Anna Semborska woke up and flipped on the radio to hear her favorite program, Sixty Minutes Per Hour. Semborska, who was seventeen, loved the way the comedy revue pushed the boundaries of what people in Poland could say out loud. Though it had been on the air for some years, with the rise of the labor union Solidarity, 60MPH had become much more bold. Sketches like one about a dim-witted Communist doctor looking vainly to find a cure for extremism were an inspiration to Anna and her teenage friends in Warsaw. The program showed her that other people felt about the world the way she did, but had never dared express. "We felt that if things like these can be said on the radio then we are free," she would remember nearly twenty years later. (1)<br><br>But when Anna ran to the radio to tune in the show on December 13, 1981, she heard only static. She tried another station, then another. Nothing. She tried to call a friend and found no dial tone. Her mother called her to the window. Tanks were rolling by. The Polish military government had declared martial law, outlawed Solidarity, and put the clamps back on the media and on speech. The Polish experiment with liberalization was over.<br><br>Within hours, Anna and her friends began to hear stories that suggested something this time was different. In a little town called 'Swidnik near the Czech border, there were the dogwalkers. Every night at 7:30, when the state-run television news came on, nearly everyone in 'Swidnik went out and walked his dog in a little park in the center of town.<br><br>It became a daily silent act of protest and solidarity. We refuse to watch. We reject your version of truth.<br><br>In Gdansk, there were the black TV screens. People there began moving their television sets to the windows-with the screens pointed out to the street. They were sending a sign to one another, and the government. We, too, refuse to watch. We also reject your version of truth.<br><br>An underground press began to grow, on ancient hand-crank equipment. People began carrying video cameras and making private documentaries, which they showed secretly in church basements. Soon, Poland's leaders acknowledged they were facing a new phenomenon, something they had to go west to name. It was the rise of Polish public opinion. In 1983, the government created the first of several institutes to study it. It mostly conducted public opinion surveys. Others would sprout up throughout Eastern Europe as well. This new phenomenon was something totalitarian officials could not dictate. At best, they could try to understand it and then manipulate it, not unlike Western democratic politicians. They would not succeed.<br><br>Afterward, leaders of the movement toward freedom would look back and think the end of Communism owed a good deal to the coming of new information technology and the effect it had on human souls. In the winter of 1989, the man who shortly would be elected Poland's new president visited with journalists in Washington. "Is it possible for a new Stalin to appear today who could murder people?" Lech Walesa asked rhetorically. No, he answered himself. In the age of computers, satellites, faxes, VCRs, "it's impossible." Technology now made information available to too many people, too quickly. And information created democracy. (2)<br><br>What is journalism for?<b><br></b><br>For the Poles and others in emerging democracies the question was answered with action. Journalism was for building community. Journalism was for citizenship. Journalism was for democracy. Millions of people, empowered by a free flow of information, became directly involved in creating a new government and new rules for the political, social, and economic life of their country. Is that always journalism's purpose? Or was that true for one moment, in one place?<br><br>In the United States for the last half century or so the question "What is journalism for?" has rarely been asked, by citizens or journalists. You owned a printing press or a broadcasting license and you produced journalism. In the United States journalism has been reduced to a simple tautology: It was whatever journalists said it was. As Maxwell King, the former editor of the <i>Philadelphia Inquirer</i>, has said, "We let our work speak for itself." Or, when pressed, journalists take it as a given that they work in the public interest. (3)<br><br>This simplistic answer is no longer sufficient &#x2014; if it ever really was to an increasingly skeptical public. Not now that the new communications technology with which anyone with a modem and a computer can claim to be "doing journalism." Not now that the technology has created a new economic organization of journalism in which the norms of journalism are being pulled and redefined, and sometimes abandoned.<br><br>Perhaps, some suggest, the definition of journalism has been exploded by technology, so now anything is seen as journalism.<br><br>But on closer examination, as the people of Poland demonstrated, the purpose of journalism is not defined by technology, or by journalists or the techniques they employ. As we will show, the principles and purpose of journalism are defined by something more basic &#x2014; the function news plays in the lives of people.<br><br>For all that the face of journalism has changed, indeed, its purpose has remained remarkably constant, if not always well served, since the notion of "a press" first evolved more than three hundred years ago. And for all that the speed, techniques, and character of news delivery have changed, there already exists a clear theory and philosophy of journalism that flows out of the function of news.<br><br><i>The primary purpose of journalism is to provide citizens with the information they need to be free and self-governing.</i><br><br>As we listened to citizens and journalists, we heard that this obligation to citizens encompasses several elements. The news media help us define our communities, and help us create a common language and common knowledge rooted in reality. Journalism also helps identify a community's goals, heroes, and villains. "I've felt strongly for a long time that we proceed best as a society if we have a common base of information," NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw told our academic research partners. (4) The news media serve as a watchdog, push people beyond complacency, and offer a voice to the forgotten. "I want to give voices to people who need the voice . . . people who are powerless," said Yuen Tying Chan, a former reporter for the New York Daily News who has created a journalism training program in Hong Kong.5 James Carey, one of the founders of our committee, has put it this way in his own writing: Perhaps in the end journalism simply means carrying on and amplifying the conversation of people themselves. (6)<br><br>This definition has held so consistent through history, and proven so deeply ingrained in the thinking of those who produce news through the ages, that it is in little doubt. It is difficult, in looking back, even to separate the concept of journalism from the concept of creating community and later democracy. Journalism is so fundamental to that purpose that, as we will see, societies that want to suppress freedom must first suppress the press. They do not, interestingly, have to suppress capitalism. At its best, as we will also show, journalism reflects a subtle understanding of how citizens behave, an understanding that we call the Theory of the Interlocking Public.<br><br>Yet the longstanding theory and purpose of journalism are being challenged today in ways not seen before, at least in the United States. Technology is shaping a new economic organization of information companies, which is subsuming journalism inside it. The threat is no longer simply from government censorship. The new danger is that independent journalism may be dissolved in the solvent of commercial communication and synergistic self-promotion. The real meaning of the First Amendment &#x2014; that a free press is an independent institution &#x2014; is threatened for the first time in our history even without government meddling.<br><br>There are some who will contend that defining journalism is dangerous. To define journalism, they argue, is to limit it. Maybe doing so violates the spirit of the First Amendment: "Congress shall make no law . . . abridging the freedom of speech or of the press." This is why journalists have avoided licensing, like doctors and lawyers, they note. They also worry that defining journalism will only make it resistant to changing with the times, which probably will run it out of business.<br><br>Actually, the resistance to definition in journalism is not a deeply held principle but a fairly recent and largely commercial impulse. Publishers a century ago routinely championed their news values in front-page editorials, opinion pages, and company slogans, and just as often publicly assailed the journalistic values of their rivals. This was marketing. Citizens chose which publications to read based on their style and their approach to news. It was only as the press began to assume a more corporate and monopolistic form that it became more reticent. Lawyers also advised news companies against codifying their principles in writing for fear that they would be used against them in court. Avoiding definition was a commercial strategy. It was not born of the meaning of the First Amendment.<br><br>On the other side, some will argue that not only should journalism's purpose be unchanging, but its form should be constant as well. They see changes in the way journalism looks from when they were young, and fear that, in the memorable phrase of Neil Postman, we are "amusing ourselves to death." They miss another fact. Every generation creates its own journalism.<br><br>But the purpose, we have found, is the same.<br><br>Though journalists are uncomfortable defining what they do, they do fundamentally agree on their purpose. When we set out in 1997 to chart the common ground of newspeople, this was the first answer we heard: "The central purpose of journalism is to tell the truth so that people will have the information that they need to be sovereign." It came from Jack Fuller, an author, novelist, lawyer, and president of the Tribune Publishing Company, which produces the <i>Chicago Tribune</i>. (7)<br><br>Even people who resist the label of journalist, who work on the Web, offer a similar goal. Omar Wasow, a self-described "garage entrepreneur" who founded a website called New York Online, told us at one committee forum that his aim, in part, was helping to create citizens who are "consumers, devourers and debunkers of media . . . an audience who have engaged with the product and can respond carefully." (8)<br><br>Were these just disparate voices? Not really. In collaboration with the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press, we asked journalists what they considered the distinguishing feature of journalism. Those working in news volunteered this democratic function by nearly two to one over any other answer. (9) Open-ended in-depth interviews with a hundred more journalists conducted by developmental psychologists at Stanford, Harvard, and the University of Chicago with whom we collaborated came to the same conclusion. "News professionals at every level . . . express an adamant allegiance to a set of core standards that are striking in their commonality and in their linkage to the public information mission," they write. (10)<br><br>Ethics codes and journalism mission statements bear the same witness. The goal is "to serve the general welfare by informing the people," says the code of the American Society of Newspaper Editors, the largest association of print newsroom managers in North America. "Give light and the people will find their own way," reads the masthead of Scripps Company newspapers. Indeed, every newspaper mission statement on file with the American Society of Newspaper Editors names advancing self-government as the primary goal of the news organization. (11)<br><br>Those outside journalism, too, understand a broader social and moral obligation for journalism. Listen to Pope John Paul II in June 2000: "With its vast and direct influence on public opinion, journalism cannot be guided only by economic forces, profit, and special interest.

Remarkably, today's problems in China are spiritual in nature-"a crisis of faith"-stemming from the clash between capitalist realities and lingering socialist values and ideas.<br><br><i>The Deng Xiaoping Era </i>is the story of that crisis and of Deng Xiaoping's promise of socialist democracy that has degenerated into bureaucratic capitalism. Maurice Meisner shows how the social contract between the Chinese Communist Party and the people was grossly violated by the Deng regime, and why capitalism has emerged as the dynamic force in today's socioeconomic and cultural life. Now, after more than a decade of capitalist reforms, he argues that Chinese spiritual malaise is deepening with the brutal suppression of the 1989 Democracy Movement and its politically repressive aftermath.<br><br>This is an indispensable study of contemporary Chinese history-from the Chinese Revolution and the founding of the Maoist state to the establishment of the Deng regime and the social consequences of Deng's reforms-as well as a formidable analysis of the failure of the world's greatest socialist experiment. <br></p><p><b>Maurice Meisner</b>, Harvey Goldberg Professor of History at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, is the author of <i>Mao's China and After</i>.<br>A case of life imitating stereotype, with Meisner (History/Univ. of Wisconsin, Madison) expressing the hope that socialism in China may be rescued by a revolution against the Communist regime. There are two aims in this book: a ``historical narrative of post-Mao China'' and ``an extended commentary on the fate of socialism in late-twentieth century China.'' Much of the narrative is useful, including a good analysis of how Deng Xiaoping consolidated his power, how he maneuvered to isolate his anointed successor Zhao Ziyang, and Zhao's motives in opposing him at the time of the uprising in Tiananmen Square. As Meisner notes, Deng's commitment to socialism and democracy did not long survive his accession to power. He showed great finesse in wooing the youth and intelligentsia, and promptly forgot about them. The value of the analysis of socialism is something else. He points out that socialism, at least in its simplistic Stalinist rendering, ``meant little more than the nationalization of productive property.'' This notion, he justly observes, was not only appealing in its simplicity, but ``no threat to bureaucratic rule.'' But his own conception suggests a view of socialism that may never have been tried. Other bothersome aspects include an unskeptical treatment of statistics, the more surprising in a period when Soviet statistics have been revealed to be dramatically inaccurate. Most ``odd, or at best quixotic,'' to use his own description, is his apparent hope that ``something of socialism can be salvaged within the framework of the existing sociopolitical system,'' and that some kind of socialist revolution against the ``savage capitalism'' of the Communist government may do the trick. Further evidence perhaps that the most passionate defenders of old-fashioned ``socialism'' may still be found on American campuses. -- <i>Copyright �1996, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Handwriting profiling is an amazingly accurate tool for assessing how people think, feel, and act. In fact, handwriting profiling is so accurate that the FBI, the CIA, and the Israeli intelligence agency Mossad use it to build detailed psychological profiles of some of the world's most dangerous individuals. And thousands of major corporations use handwriting profiling to help them make the right hiring decisions. </p><p>Handwriting expert Michelle Dresbold -- the only civilian to be invited to the United States Secret Service's Advanced Document Examination training program -- draws on her extensive experience helping law enforcement agencies around the country on cases involving kidnapping, arson, forgery, murder, embezzlement, and stalking to take us inside the mysterious world of crossed t's and dotted i's. </p><p>In <i>Sex, Lies, and Handwriting,</i> Dresbold explains how a single sentence can provide insight into a person's background, psychology, and behavior. Throughout the book, Dresbold explores the handwriting of sly politicians, convicted criminals, notorious killers, suspected cheats, and ordinary people who've written to Dresbold's "The Handwriting Doctor" column for help. She shows you how to identify the signs of a dirty rotten scoundrel and a lying, cheating, backstabbing lover. And she introduces you to some of the most dangerous traits in handwriting, including weapon-shaped letters, "shark's teeth," "club strokes," and "felon's claws." (When you see these traits in someone's script, she says, "it's time to stop reading and start running!")</p><p>Dresbold also explains how criminals are tracked through handwritten clues and what spouses, friends, or employees might be hiding in their script.</p><p>Finally, Dresbold re-examines the handwriting evidence in several notorious unsolved cases. She uncovers fascinating clues that reveal the secret side of Lizzie Borden, acquitted of the ax murder of her parents in 1893's "trial of the century." Dresbold also reveals astonishing details about the author of the JonBen�t Ramsey ransom note, and she presents startling new evidence that exposes the real Jack the Ripper (contrary to popular theories, he wasn't a prince or a painter after all). </p><p><i>Sex, Lies, and Handwriting</i> will have you paying a bit more attention to your -- and everyone else's -- penmanship.</p></p><p><b>Michelle Dresbold,</b> a graduate of the United States Secret Service's Advanced Document Examination training program, is considered one of the top experts in the nation on handwriting identification, personality profiling, and threat analysis. She consults to private attorneys, police departments, and prosecutors throughout the United States. Dresbold writes a syndicated column, "The Handwriting Doctor." She is also an accomplished artist. She lives in Pittsburgh, PA. <p>For more information visit www.michelledresbold.com</p>When I first got a call from Commander Ronald Freeman, my heart started pounding. "Oh, no," I thought, "I knew I should have paid those darn parking tickets!" But Freeman didn't even mention the tickets. He said that he had heard through the grapevine that I could "read" people, and asked me to come in for a chat. <p> At division headquarters, Commander Freeman had a stack of old case files involving handwriting piled on his desk. For hours, he showed me suicide notes, confessions, threatening letters, and other writing, and asked me questions like: "Is this person male or female? How old? Is the writer violent? Suicidal? Honest or dishonest? Straight or gay? Sane or insane? Smart or stupid? Healthy or sick? Go-getter or lazy bum?" After every answer, he smiled. Although he never said so, this was a test. </p><p> I must have passed, because a few days later, I got my first assignment: To profile an UNSUB (police lingo for unidentified subject) from a bank robbery note. </p><p> "This is a stick up," the note said. "Put $50's, $20's, $10's in bag." </p><p> After scanning the note for a few minutes, I turned to the detective in charge of the case. "You're not gonna find this guy's prints in your files, because he probably never committed a crime before. He's not a hardcore criminal. Under normal circumstances, he'd never rob a bank. But he's feeling really desperate." The detective nodded his head politely, but I could tell that he was skeptical. </p><p> A few days later, the bank robber was in police custody. As I had predicted, he was not a hardened criminal. In fact, he had no previous arrest record. He was a 52-year-old bus driver who tearfully confessed that he needed money to pay for his son's liver transplant. "Without the operation my son will die," he said. </p><p> </p><p> One day, a woman walking her dog on Aylesboro Avenue in Pittsburgh found a mysterious note on the sidewalk. Printed in purple crayon were the words: Ples rascu me. Thinking it could be a desperate plea for help, the woman brought the note to a police station. </p><p> The detectives wondered if the note was a hoax. It appeared to be the writing of a child, but was it? And did the writer really need to be rescued? </p><p> "It's not the writing of an adult pretending to be a child," I told the lead detective. "It was written by a girl between the ages of five and seven. And I see absolutely no signs of stress or danger in the handwriting, so the writer is definitely not a kidnap victim." Then I added, "It's signed Kealsey." </p><p> But who was Kealsey? And why did Kealsey write the note? We turned to the news media, hoping that someone might recognize the handwriting, or something in the note, that could help us unravel the mystery. </p><p> That night when I turned on the six o'clock news, a reporter was interviewing another handwriting analyst who proclaimed that he could tell from the handwriting that the note's author was in "grave danger." </p><p> "What if I'm wrong?" I thought. </p><p> The next morning, a man and his daughter walked into the police station. They had seen a photograph of the note in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. The 6-year-old daughter, Kealsey, timidly stated that she had written the message to her teddy bear. Her father explained that Kealsey often played detective with her teddy. Somehow the note must have blown out the window and landed on the sidewalk. </p><p> </p><p> Copyright � 2006 by Michelle Dresbold and James Kwalwasser</p></p><h2>Buddenbrooks</h2><p>A Major Literary Event: a brilliant new translation of Thomas Mann's first great novel, one of the two for which he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1929.<br><br>Buddenbrooks, first published in Germany in 1900, when Mann was only twenty-five, has become a classic of modem literature -- the story of four generations of a wealthy bourgeois family in northern Germany. With consummate skill, Mann draws a rounded picture of middle-class life: births and christenings; marriages, divorces, and deaths; successes and failures. These commonplace occurrences, intrinsically the same, vary slightly as they recur in each succeeding generation. Yet as the Buddenbrooks family eventually succumbs to the seductions of modernity -- seductions that are at variance with its own traditions -- its downfall becomes certain.<br><br>In immensity of scope, richness of detail, and fullness of humanity, Buddenbrooks surpasses all other modem family chronicles; it has, indeed, proved a model for most of them. Judged as the greatest of Mann's novels by some critics, it is ranked as among the greatest by all. Thomas Mann was awarded the Nobel Prize for literature in 1929.<br><i>From the Hardcover edition.</i></p><p>"A remarkable achievement.... In Mr. Woods's sparkling new translation, the reader now encounters a work that is closer in style, vocabulary, idiom and tone to the original." --<i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> First published in 1900, when Thomas Mann was twenty-five, <i>Buddenbrooks</i> is a minutely imagined chronicle of four generations of a North German mercantile family--a work so true to life that it scandalized the author's former neighbors in his native L�beck. As he charts the Buddenbrooks' decline from prosperity to bankruptcy, from moral and psychic soundness to sickly piety, artistic decadence, and madness, Mann ushers the reader into a world of rich vitality, pieced together from births and funerals, weddings and divorces, recipes, gossip, and earthy humor.</p><p> Now Mann's triumph of realism is available in its first new English version in seventy years. With perfect fidelity, John E. Woods gives us a <i>Buddenbrooks</i> that is rich in dialect and varied in tone, exuberant in its wordplay and unfettered in its comedy. He has restored a classic to its origins and put blood back in its veins.</p><p> "A cause for rejoicing." --<i>Library Journal</i></p><p> "Wonderfully fresh and elegant ... bound to become the definitive English version ... essential reading for anybody who wishes to enter Mann's fictional universe." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i></p>John E. Woods is the distinguished translator of many books -- most notably Arno Schmidt's Evening Edged in Gold, for which he won both the American Book Award for translation and the PEN Translation Prize; Patrick Suskind's Perfume, for which he again won the PEN Translation Prize in 1987; Mr. Suskind's The Pigeon and Mr. Summer's Story; Doris Dorrie's Love, Pain, and the Whole Damn Thing and What Do You Want from Me?; and Libuse Monikova's The Facade.

And he had never, in his wildest dreams, thought of living anywhere but Garland Farm commune&nbsp;with his hippie caretaker, Rain.&nbsp;Capricorn (Cap for short) had lived every day of his life on Garland Farm growing fruits and vegetables.

He published his first book at the young age of fourteen and has been going strong ever since. A tireless self-promoter, Gordon is constantly traveling across the country to visit different schools. He and his wife, a teacher, live on Long Island with their three children.*Starred Review* Homeschooled on an isolated "alternate farm commune" that has dwindled since the 1960s to 2 members, 13-year-old Cap has always lived with his grandmother, Rain. When she is hospitalized, Cap is taken in by a social worker and sent&#x2014;like a lamb to slaughter&#x2014;to middle school. Smart and capable, innocent and inexperienced (he learned to drive on the farm, but he has never watched television), long-haired Cap soon becomes the butt of pranks. He reacts in unexpected ways and, in the end, elevates those around him to higher ground. From chapter to chapter, the first-person narrative shifts among certain characters: Cap, a social worker (who takes him into her home), her daughter (who resents his presence there), an A-list bully, a Z-list victim, a popular girl, the school principal, and a football player (who unintentionally decks Cap twice in one day). Korman capably manages the shifting points of view of characters who begin by scorning or resenting Cap and end up on his side. From the eye-catching jacket art to the scene in which Cap says good-bye to&nbsp;his 1,100 fellow students, individually and by name, this rewarding novel features an engaging main character and some memorable moments of comedy, tenderness, and reflection. Pair this with Jerry Spinelli's 2000 Stargirl&nbsp;(the sequel is reviewed in this issue) for a discussion of the stifling effects of conformity within school culture or just read it for the fun of it.

Winegardner is reminiscent of David Halberstam in his research and reporting style, as he faithfully chronicles the events and emotions of the Lucadello scouting trips. The behind-the-scenes insight into baseball scouting alone is worthy reading, but the book's ending is more dramatic than any fictional account. Winegardner's honest writing style makes his admiration of Lucadello contagious. For another Lucadello book see David V. Hanneman's Diamonds in the Rough, reviewed above.--Ed.<br><i>-Martin J. Hu dacs, Towanda H.S., Pa.</i><br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.From 1942 to 1988, the late Tony Lucadello was a baseball scout. Working first for the Chicago Cubs and then for the Philadelphia Phillies, he signed up 50 players who went on to the major leagues, including such stars as Ferguson Jenkins and Mike Schmidt. Winegardner, who accompanied Lucadello during his last year on the job, depicts an uncommonly generous man who sat through hundreds of college, high school and sandlot games, ever on the lookout for young men with the "right stuff" to take them to the top--and always willing to help them. In illuminating Lucadello's life, which ended in suicide, Winegardner ( Elvis Presley Boulevard ) evokes the spirit of baseball. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Medicine of the Earth: Legends, Recipes, Remedies, and Cultivation of Healing Plants</h2><p>Culinary recipes, medicinal preparations, cosmetic uses, and aromatherapies of 33 common herbal plants.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanFischer-Rizzi lives in the German Alps and includes many stories of European, especially German, folklore and religious myths as well as pertinent excerpts from literary prose and poetry in what is decidedly not the usual herbal remedy book.

W. Boreham was 83 when he wrote it. It&#39;s Boreham at his best. The text sparkles with wit and wisdom. Though this will appeal to people of any age, it will especially be comforting to those who are in crisis or even facing death. Pastor Jeff Cranston provides a preface within the ten Roman numeral pages of front matter. An &#34;About the Cover&#34; section is included in the back.</p><p>BOREHAM, FRANK WILLIAM (1871-1959), preacher and writer, was born on March 3, 1871 at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, England, eldest child of Francis Boreham, solicitor&#39;s clerk, and his wife Fanny Usher. He was educated and was later a pupil-teacher at Grosvenor United School, Tunbridge Wells. In December 1884 he became junior clerk with a local brickworks where, in a locomotive accident, he lost his right foot, necessitating the life-long use of a stick. Late in 1887 he went to work as a clerk in London, becoming increasingly involved in church, debating and writing activities. Although his family was Anglican, he was baptized at Stockwell Old Baptist Church in 1890; he preached from pavement and pulpit and published &#34;Won to Glory&#34; in 1891. He was admitted to Spurgeon&#39;s College, London, in August 1892, serving as a student-minister at Theydon Bois, Essex, where he met Estella Maud Mary Cottee. In 1894 Boreham was called to the Scottish community at Mosgiel near Dunedin in New Zealand, and was inducted on March 17, 1895. Stella, then 18, followed to marry him at Kaiapoi on April 13, 1896. Boreham became president of the Baptist Union of New Zealand in 1902, and published &#34;The Whisper of God and Other Sermons.&#34; He wrote editorials for the Otago Daily Times, contributed to theological journals and, as a keen temperance advocate, participated in liquor polls in 1905 and 1907. In June 1906 Boreham was called to the Baptist Tabernacle, Hobart. He edited the Southern Baptist and later the weekly Australian Baptist and in 1910 became president of the Tasmanian Baptist Union. His &#34;George Augustus Selwyn&#34; was published in 1911. He wrote a biographical series for the Hobart Mercury, which in 40 years covered 2000 persons; in 1912-59 he contributed 2500 editorials to the Mercury and the Melbourne Age. Boreham&#39;s 80 publications, including religious works, homiletic essays and novels, sold over one million copies.</p><h2>Authentic Christianity (Studies in the Book of Acts)</h2><p><p><strong>"There can be no more urgent question at this present time than just this: What is Christianity?"</strong></p> <p>Some define it as an elevated, optimistic philosophy of life. Many regard it as a set of morals to live by, or a good feeling about yourself, or doing good things. Still others dismiss it as something for the intellectually weak.</p> <p>Within these pages, however, Martyn Lloyd-Jones challenges you to think through exactly what you believe Christianity to be and the role it has in your life. He believes that today's understanding of Christianity, even as defined by many who consider themselves to be its followers, is in complete contrast to what is taught in the Bible. Christianity is not a list of things for you to do, but rather, your only true hope, for it tells what Jesus came to do <em>for you.</em></p> <p>That you may know Jesus as your Savior and know Him more fully is Lloyd-Jones's desire as he shares in these messages from the book of Acts the basic truths of genuine Christianity.</p> <p><b>About this Series</b></p> <p>The book of Acts is filled with some of the most powerful accounts in the New Testament. The birth of the church. The coming of the Holy Spirit. Bold preaching and dramatic missionary journeys. Saved souls and transformed lives. It not only provides insight into the growing apostolic church, but can encourage and challenge your heart today.</p> <p>Martyn Lloyd-Jones preached on this dynamic Bible book during the peak of his ministry. Now those expository sermons are gathered together in a multi-volume collection. His language is simple and clear so that the truth of the Scriptures would be available to all who desire to understand. Recognized as one of this century's most gifted preachers, he is known for his astute analysis of man's condition and his persuasive proclamation of the Gospel as the only true solution.</p></p><p></p><h2>With a Bare Bodkin</h2><p>A Francis Pettigrew mystery, originally published in 1946. England is in the grip of the Second World War and the Blitz has forced the evacuation of various government offices from London. Francis Pettigrew, an unsuccessful barrister and amateur detective, accompanies his ministry to the distant seaside resort of Marsett Bay where the civil servants must make the best of their temporary home. In this strange atmosphere, Pettigrew begins to fall in love with his secretary, Miss Brown, who is also being courted by a widowed man who is much older than her. Bored and restless, the ministers start playing a light-hearted game of &#39;plan the perfect murder&#39; to pass the time. Pettigrew, caught up in his love for Miss Brown, remains detached from the silliness - until a real murder happens, and he is drawn into solving the mystery. &#39;One of the best detective stories published for a long time.&#39; Spectator</p><p>Cyril Hare was the pseudonym of Judge Gordon Clark. Born at Mickleham near Dorking in 1900, he was educated at Rugby and New College, Oxford. At the bar his practice was largely in the criminal courts. During the Second World War he was on the staff of the Director of Public Prosecutions; but later, as a County Court judge, his work concerned civil disputes only - and his sole connection with crime was through his fiction. He turned to writing detective stories at the age of thirty-six and some of his first short stories were published in Punch. Hare went on to write a series of detective novels.

But above all else, the Callahans love one another. This may not sound like the makings for high drama or complex fine literature, but that was not what author John Edward was after. As an internationally acclaimed psychic medium, Edward spends most of his days helping survivors work through the seemingly unbearable grief of losing a loved one. As a result, Edward wanted to offer a comforting message about the everlasting love that can bridge even death.<p> In order to get this message across, Edward presents a story about an endearing and seriously devoted family as they endure the final goodbye to a beloved matriarch. Soon after Timothy discoveries that his mother is dying of cancer, the family gathers to view old family movies. While watching the faces of deceased relatives on the movie screen, he begins to ponder the afterlife.</p><p> "As I look over at my mom, I know that she's wondering if all these faces of yesteryear will be the faces of her tomorrows. Will she see them when she crosses over? Will her loved ones welcome her on the other side, as we all want to believe? I hope so."</p><p> While his mother's cancer progresses, the narrator flashes back to his childhood when his mother explained that God was the sun, an epiphany that becomes more tangible as he wrestles with impending death. Readers who don't expect haute literature will be touched by this tearjerker story that offers tenderness and comfort. It's also an excellent book to give to those who are open to afterlife discussions and are grieving the loss of a loved one. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p>John Edward is an internationally acclaimed psychic medium, and the author of many bestselling books including: Crossing Over, One Last Time,and After Life.

He lives with his wife on Long Island.</p><h2>Salem&#39;s Lot</h2><p>When a writer returns to his small Maine hometown, he discovers that the peaceful hamlet is being overrun by vampires and sets out to curb this ancient evil before it can spread, in a new edition of the classic horror novel featuring an introduction by the author . Reprint.</p><p>Stephen King's second book, <i>'Salem's Lot</i> (1975)--about the slow takeover of an insular hamlet called Jerusalem's Lot by a vampire patterned after Bram Stoker's Dracula--has two elements that he also uses to good effect in later novels: a small American town, usually in Maine, where people are disconnected from each other, quietly nursing their potential for evil; and a mixed bag of rational, goodhearted people, including a writer, who band together to fight that evil. <p> Simply taken as a contemporary vampire novel, <i>'Salem's Lot</i> is great fun to read, and has been very influential in the horror genre. But it's also a sly piece of social commentary. As King said in 1983, "In <i>'Salem's Lot</i>, the thing that really scared me was not vampires, but the town in the daytime, the town that was empty, knowing that there were things in closets, that there were people tucked under beds, under the concrete pilings of all those trailers. And all the time I was writing that, the Watergate hearings were pouring out of the TV.... Howard Baker kept asking, 'What I want to know is, what did you know and when did you know it?' That line haunts me, it stays in my mind.... During that time I was thinking about secrets, things that have been hidden and were being dragged out into the light." Sounds quite a bit like the idea behind his 1998 novel of a Maine hamlet haunted by unsightly secrets, <i>Bag of Bones</i>. <i>--Fiona Webster</i></p><b>Stephen King</b> is the author of more than fifty books, all of them worldwide bestsellers.

Although this book is designed to be a useful record of your gardening activities, the diary pages are the heart of the book. As the years pass, it becomes even more enjoyable reading past entries.

In fact, we hope that you use it to record the first date that the robins returned or what you did the day your first grandchild was born. The book has ample space for ten years of entries and can be started any time. There is a perpetual calendar at the back which will serve until 2099 A.D. Don&#39;t let yourself be restricted to the lines allocated for one year. On any specific date you will have much to say one year, the next, very little. You will find that the random entries have a way of balancing the space. It is far more important to make this book enjoyable than it is to make it a sterile record. The how-to-use guide should be treated as a guide only. Write in this book often and anywhere you see fit.

True to the title, the book is a history of crime both organized and not that permeated the dirty underbelly of New York City and its boroughs in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some of these gangs were so vicious they would post signs warning police to stay out of their neighborhoods or else! The 1927 volume is the basis of Martin Scorsese's forthcoming film of the same name starring Daniel Day-Lewis and Titanic heartthrob Leonardo DiCaprio, so make sure to have at least one copy on hand.

Raymond, 13, and Hugh, a young street thief, are shipwrecked on Dinotopia Island, where humans and dinosaurs live in idyllic harmony. Raymond adjusts quickly, but Hugh's hard life has not prepared him for this peaceful communal existence. His feelings of inadequacy are echoed in Windchaser, a reclusive dinosaur, and he resolves to communicate with the outcast creature. The story is episodic and choppy. Characters are introduced and disappear, sometimes within a single page, distracting attention from the main story line. Dialogue is equally inconsistent. Hugh's London street dialect comes and goes at random and Raymond often slips into unnaturally formal speech. The cliche-filled writing and intrusive philosophizing also contribute to the lack of continuity. Dinotopia lacks the logical foundation necessary for a fully realized imagined world.

It not only explains the mechanics of great skiing; it also shows how it looks-step by step-and describes how it should feel. </p><p>The first step to improving is to gain a deeper understanding of the mechanics of superb skiing. Technique expert Ron LeMaster explains how the skis interact with the snow and then reveals how to manipulate your skis, boots, and poles to achieve the carved turns, jumps, and pinpoint control that make skiing one of the most exciting winter sports. </p><p>But that's only the beginning. LeMaster goes on to present the most effective techniques for executing skiing's five most important body movements:</p><p>- Vertical movements<br>- Fore-aft movements<br>- Lateral balancing movements<br>- Rotary movements<br>- Edging movements</p><p>Each major point on technique is accompanied by kinesthetic descriptions to give you a keen sense of how these key movements should feel. You'll also learn how to apply your newly acquired skills in a variety of skiing situations: </p><p>- mogul skiing, <br>- skiing on very hard snow and ice, <br>- powder skiing,<br>- skiing steep terrain,<br>- and skiing fast.</p><p>And it doesn't stop there. <i>The Skier's Edge</i> augments its instruction with photographs of some of the best skiers in the world, including World Cup racers and top-ranked instructors. Much more than ordinary snapshots, these unique photomontages clearly illustrate correct techniques with multiple images, guiding you through the sequence of movements from start to finish.</p><p>Luckily, you don't need to be a biomechanist or physicist to understand <i>The Skier's Edge</i>! LeMaster puts the scientific principles and mathematical equations underlying his instruction into common terms and relates them to experiences familiar to even less experienced skiers. </p><p>If you're dedicated to achieving your skiing potential, this book will help you boost your performance to the next level. If you teach or coach skiers, this book is an excellent resource for expanding your knowledge base and increasing the effectiveness of your instruction.</p><p></p></p><p>"A great tool for athletes looking to understand the sport and for coaches looking for ways to articulate their critique. Technical enough for left-brainers yet easy to understand for right-brainers. LeMaster explains sensations I&#x2019;ve never been able to put into words." <p>Edith Thys Senior Editor, SKI Magazine Two-time Olympian </p><p>"A must read for all ski instructors, ski professionals, and good skiers who want to get better." </p><p>Norman D.

Even though she identifies two Arapaho troublemakers, Ned's family clings to the belief that Marcy herself was responsible. Convinced of Marcy's innocence, Vicki agrees to represent the outsider- and finds herself at odds with her own people. <br><br> She also finds herself at odds with Father John, because the mission priest has glimpsed something in the beautiful girl that shakes him to his core. And when the men Marcy has accused of murdering her fianc� are found dead in an abandoned barn, Vicky and Father John realize they are caught in a web of lies and deceit woven by a master.</p><p>Margaret Coel is the <b>New York Times</b> bestselling, award-winning author of <b>The Thunder Keeper, The Spirit Woman, The Lost Bird, The Story Teller, The Dream Stalker, The Ghost Walker, The Eagle Catcher</b>, and several works of nonfiction. She has also authored many articles on the people and places of the American West. Her work has won national and regional awards. Her first John O'Malley mystery, <b>The Eagle Catcher</b>, was a national bestseller, garnering excellent reviews from the <b>Denver Post</b>, Tony Hillerman, Jean Hager, Loren D. Estleman, Stephen White, Earlene Fowler, Ann Ripley and other top writers in the field. A native of Colorado, she resides in Boulder.When Ned Windsong, an Arapaho who recently returned to the Wind River Reservation, is murdered, the beautiful outsider Marcy Morrison, his fianc�e, identifies two Arapaho troublemakers as the killers. But despite that, Marcy feels she is a suspect herself and hires Arapaho attorney Vicky Holden. In addition, Father John O&#x2019;Malley agrees to let Marcy stay at the mission. Father John senses something off about Marcy, but there is no shortage of suspects, including Lionel and Dwayne, the troublemakers, and Ned&#x2019;s old girlfriend, Roseanne Birdwoman. Father John and Vicky soon find that Ned was involved in a series of burglaries, and the two discover lies piled upon deceit as they try to find out who killed Ned. Coel&#x2019;s fifteenth mystery set on the Wind River Reservation stands on its own, with enough background information about Father John and Vicky Holden to help new readers keep up. Coel also subtly works in Arapaho customs as well the social troubles facing those on the reservation, making for a meaty mystery. --Kat Kan</p><h2>The 7 Churches Not in the Book of Revelation</h2><p>Whether you are a part of a corporation church where the pastor operates as a CEO or a university church where the pastor is the &#x201c;professor,&#x201d; Gene Mims will help you adjust your style to the church culture you serve.

Streisand. Dylan. Pavarotti. McCartney. Sting. Madonna. What do these musicians have in common besides their super-stardom? They have all worked with legendary music producer Phil Ramone.<br><br> For almost five decades, Phil Ramone has been a force in the music industry. He has produced records and collaborated with almost every major talent in the business. There is a craft to making records, and Phil has spent his life mastering it. For the first time ever, he shares the secrets of his trade.<br><br> <em>Making Records</em> is a fascinating look "behind the glass" of a recording studio. From Phil's exhilarating early days recording jazz and commercial jingles at A&amp;R, to his first studio, and eventual legendary producer status, Phil allows you to sit in on the sessions that created some of the most memorable music of the 20th century--including Frank Sinatra's <em>Duets</em> album, Bob Dylan's <em>Blood on the Tracks</em>, Ray Charles's <em>Genius Loves Company</em> and Paul Simon's <em>Still Crazy After All These Years</em>.<br><br> In addition to being a ringside seat for contemporary popular music history, <em>Making Records</em> is an unprecedented tutorial on the magic behind what music producers and engineers do. In these pages, Phil offers a rare peek inside the way music is made . . . illuminating the creative thought processes behind some of the most influential sessions in music history.<br><br> This is a book about the art that is making records--the way it began, the way it is now, and everything in between.</p><p><strong>Phil Ramone</strong> was born in 1931. A violin prodigy, he studied at Juilliard before establishing his first music studio in 1961. In addition to his producing activities, Ramone is also extremely active in music and service related organizations. He is the Chairman Emeritus of the Board of Trustees of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS) and the Producers and Engineers Wing, and is a Trustee of the MusiCares Foundation. He lives in Westchester County, NY.Ramone, with 14 Grammys to his name, is the consummate Establishment producer. His clean professionalism has brought a touch of class to a wealth of baby boomer landmarks, from Paul Simon's <i>Still Crazy After All These Years</i> to Billy Joel's <i>The Stranger</i> and Ray Charles's <i>Genius Loves Company</i>. Over the course of his memoir, Ramone constantly drops these names and more, often veering into a string of anecdotes to illustrate a point. One page about artists' working methods, for example, includes mention of Frank Sinatra; Bob Dylan; Peter, Paul, and Mary; and Barbara Streisand, with little distinction made as to quality or genre. This makes for a readable but repetitive book. The conversational style means that certain artists are brought up again and again, and sometimes the book relies upon long block quotes from musicians that would have benefited from being pared down to their relevant lines (such as one in which Liberty DeVitto of Billy Joel's band talks about changing the rhythm of Always a Woman to Me). Amid all of this, there are genuinely interesting stories, and fans of Sinatra, Simon and Dylan should find pleasure in the long in-studio narratives. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Clark</b> is Chancellor&#x2019;s Professor of Modern Art at the University of California, Berkeley. His books include <i>The Absolute Bourgeois: Artists and Politics in France, 1848&#x2013;51; </i><i>Image of the People: Gustave Courbet and the 1848 Revolution; </i>and <i>The Painting of Modern Life: Paris in the Art of Manet and His Followers.</i><br>No two social or aesthetic movements have been as agonizingly debated and lamented as Modernism and Socialism. Both arose in the wake of the French Revolution, and both were deemed untenable by the late 1980s. In this career-defining work, a collection of seven ruminative essays on the "co-dependency" of these concepts, eminent art historian Clark offers not so much a summation as an archeology, working through "limit cases" in the long and tortured relationship of art and politics, from David's shrewd positioning of his portrait of Citizen Marat within the fervor of the French Revolution to the perceived "anarchism" of Pissarro's laboring field women and the social meanings of Jackson Pollock's post-War drip paintings (Clark reads them in two intriguing contexts: first, as an expression of "lordly," aristocratic attitude, dismissing content in favor of form; and secondly, in terms of their use as backdrops for a 1950 Vogue magazine photo shoot). He writes about politics and art without cynicism, speaking often in the direct, if melancholy, voice of one who wants something to have been, so that it might still be. Clark's is a reclamation project: he seeks to return agency to the artists and paintings that gave face to modernity, and to steer us, as readers and interpreters, away from facile historicism on the one hand, and formalism on the other. The essays in this volume are always historically nuanced, aglow with Clark's deep learning and masterful prose; they will doubtlessly elicit much praise and be the subject of much debate. <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Art of Tracking: The Origin of Science</h2><p>In a work of painstaking and wide-ranging scholarship, backed up by fieldwork among the Kalahari hunter-gatherers, Louis Liebenberg explains how the art of tracking represents a crucial step in human evolution. Liebenberg examines the principles of tracking, and the classification and interpretation of spoor under difficult conditions. He also shows how the original speculative hypotheses of early hunter-gatherers have a direct line to the propositions of modern physicists who &#39;track&#39; sub-atomic particles. In the book, the author argues that the art of tracking involves the same intellectual and creative abilities as physics and mathematics, and may therefore represent the origin of science itself. The book has been hailed as a real contribution to our understanding of the complexity involved in the process by which indigenous peoples track and hunt animals. It is insightful, detailed and well articulated.</p><p>In addition to being an author to various books, <b>LOUIS LIEBENBERG</b> is the Managing Director at CyberTracker Conservation and the Chief Executive Director at CyberTracker Software.

But how could I think about being dead if I had died?</p><p>I thought about that, too, after I stopped having hysterics. There was plenty of time to think.</p><p>Call me Allen Carpentier. It&#x2019;s the name I wrote under, and someone will remember it. I was one of the best- known science- fiction writers in the world, and I had a lot of fans. My stories weren&#x2019;t the kind that win awards, but they entertained and I had written a lot of them. The fans all knew me. Someone ought to remember me.</p><p>It was the fans who killed me. At least, they let me do it. It&#x2019;s an old game. At science- fiction conventions the fans try to get their favorite author washed- out stinking drunk. Then they can go home and tell stories about how Allen Carpentier really tied one on and they were right there to see it. They add to the stories until legends are built around what writers do at conventions. It&#x2019;s all in fun. They really like me, and I like them.</p><p>I think I do. But the fans vote the Hugo Awards, and you have to be popular to win. I&#x2019;d been nominated five times for awards and never won one, and I was out to make friends that year. Instead of hiding in a back booth with other writers I was at a fan party, drinking with a roomful of short ugly kids with pimples, tall serious Harvard types, girls with long stringy hair, half- pretty girls half- dressed to show it, and damn few people with good manners.</p><p>Remember the drinking party in War and Peace? Where one of the characters bets he can sit on a window ledge and drink a whole bottle of rum without touching the sides? I made the same bet.</p><p>The convention hotel was a big one, and the room was eight stories up. I climbed out and sat with my feet dangling against the smooth stone building. The smog had blown away, and Los Angeles was beautiful. Even with the energy shortage there were lights everywhere, moving rivers of lights on the freeways, blue glows from swimming pools near the hotel, a grid of light stretching out as far as I could see. Somewhere out there fireworks arched up and drifted down, but I don&#x2019;t know what they were celebrating.</p><p>They handed me the rum. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re a real sport, Allen,&#x201c; said a middle- aged adolescent. He had acne and halitosis, but he published one of the biggest science- fiction newsletters around. He wouldn&#x2019;t have known a literary reference if it bit him on the nose. &#x201c;Hey, that&#x2019;s a long way down.</p><p>&#x201c; &#x201c;Right. Beautiful night, isn&#x2019;t it? Arcturus up there, see it? Star with the largest proper motion. Moved a couple of degrees in the last three thousand years. Almost races along.&#x201d;</p><p>Carpentier&#x2019;s trivial last words: a meaningless lecture to people who not only knew it already, but had read it in my own work. I took the rum and tilted my head back to drink. It was like drinking flaming battery acid. There was no plea - sure in it. I&#x2019;d regret this tomorrow. But the fans began to shout behind me, and that made me feel good until I saw why. Asimov had come in. Asimov wrote science articles and histories and straight novels and commentaries on the Bible and Byron and Shakespeare, and he turned out more material in a year than anyone else writes in a lifetime. I used to steal data and ideas from his columns. The fans were shouting for him, while I risked my neck to give them the biggest performance of all the drunken conventions of Allen Carpentier.</p><p>With nobody watching.</p><p>The bottle was half empty when my gag reflex cut in and spilled used rum into my nose and sinuses. I jackknifed forward to cough it out of my lungs and pitched right over. I don&#x2019;t think anyone saw me fall. It was an accident, a stupid accident caused by stupid drunkenness, and it was all the fans&#x2019; fault anyway. They had no business letting me do it! And it was an accident, I know it was. I wasn&#x2019;t feeling that sorry for myself.</p><p>The city was still alive with lights. A big Roman candle burst with brilliant pinpoints of yellows and greens against the starry skies. The view was pleasant as I floated down the side of the hotel.</p><p>It seemed to take a long time to get to the bottom.</p><p>Excerpted from Inferno by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.</p><p>Copyright � 1976 by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle.</p><p>Published in September 2008 by Tom Doherty Associates, LLC.</p><p>All rights reserved.

But how are Christians supposed to discern what lessons from history need to be learned?<br><br> In this small but thoughtful volume, respected theologian and churchman Rowan Williams opens up a theological approach to history, an approach that is both nonpartisan and relevant to the church's present needs. As he reflects on how we consider the past in general, Williams suggests that how we consider church history in particular remains important not so much for winning arguments as for clarifying who we are as time-bound human beings. Good history is a moral affair, he advises, because it opens up a point of reference that is distinct from us yet not wholly alien. The past can then enable us to think with more varied and resourceful analogies about our identity in the often confusing present.</p><p>Rowan Williams served as the 104th Archbishop of Canterbury from 2002 to 2012 and is now Master of Magdalene College, University of Cambridge. A Fellow of the British Academy and an internationally recognized theologian, he was previously Lady Margaret Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford, Bishop of Monmouth, and Archbishop of Wales."Good historical writing constructs our sense of who we are by a real engagement with the strangeness of the past. . . . Bad history is any kind of narrative that refuses this difficulty and enlargement &#x2014; whether by giving us a version of the past that is just the present in fancy dress or by dismissing the past as a wholly foreign country whose language we shall never learn."</p><h2>Raising Puppies &amp; Kids Together: A Guide for Parents</h2><p>Maintaining a safe and happy household that includes both puppies and children can be a challenging task.

While there are plenty of books describing her periods of urban life in Bath, Southampton and London, and the summer holidays in Lyme Regis and other West Country seaside resorts, no book has given consideration to the rural background of her life. Her father was not only the rector of Steventon but a farmer there as well, managing a property of some 200 acres. Her brother Edward, in addition, was a large landowner, holding the three estates of Godmersham in Kent, Steventon and Chawton in Hampshire. Agriculture, in all its aspects, was even more important to Jane than clerical life or the naval careers of her younger brothers. This book fills a gap in the Austen family background, discussing the state of agriculture in general in the south of England during the wartime, conditions which lasted for most of Jane Austen's life, and considering in particular the villages and their inhabitants, the weather conditions, field crops, farm and domestic animals, and the Austens' household economy and rural way of life. Apart from these obvious sources, there are other Austen family manuscripts, as yet unpublished, which provide particular and unique information. Richly illustrated with contemporary depictions of country folk, landscapes and animals, <i>Jane Austen's Country Life</i> conjures up a world which has vanished more than the familiar regency townscapes of Bath or London, but which is no less important to an understanding of this most treasured writer's life and work.</p></p><p><p>Deirdre Le Faye is an expert on Jane Austen, and the author of several books about her, including the definitive factual biography <i>Jane Austen: A Family Record </i>(Cambridge University Press) and completely new editions of Jane Austen&#x2019;s letters for Oxford University Press.

Belknap, concerned that accident and carelessness were jeopardizing America's documentary heritage, proposed an organization to provide a secure repository for rare manuscripts and printed works and a publication program to "multiply the copies" of these valuable items. The Society that eight Boston gentlemen created that evening was the first institution anywhere for "the collection and preservation of materials for a political and natural history of the United States."<br>The Massachusetts Historical Society: A Bicentennial History, 1791-1991, is a candid and detailed account of this remarkable institution's first two centuries. Despite its location and its name, the Society has never been a provincial institution, dedicated to chronicling the story of a single city or state. Through its incomparable library and publications, as well as through the writings of such illustrious members as Belknap, Francis Parkman, William Hickling Prescott, Samuel Eliot Morison, and scores of modern scholars, the Society has been - and continues to be - a profound influence on the study of a nation's history.</p><p>Louis Leonard Tucker is the Director of the Massachusetts Historical Society.</p><h2>The Awakening and Selected Stories (Modern Library)</h2><p>Edited with an Introduction, by Nina Baym</p><p><b>The Awakening</b> shocked turn-of-the-century readers and reviewers with its treatment of sex and suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;In a departure from literary convention, Kate Chopin failed to condemn her heroine's desire for an affair with the son of a Louisiana resort owner, whom she meets on vacation.&nbsp;&nbsp;The power of sensuality, the delusion of ecstatic love, and the solitude that accompanies the trappings of middle- and upper-class convention are themes of this now-classic novel.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>The book was influenced by French writers ranging from Flaubert to Maupassant, and can be seen as a precursor of the impressionistic, mood-driven novels of Virginia Woolf and Djuna Barnes.&nbsp;&nbsp;Variously called "vulgar," "unhealthily introspective," and "morbid," the book was neglected for several decades, not least because it was written by a "regional" woman writer.&nbsp;&nbsp;This edition also includes selected stories from Kate Chopin's <b>Bayou Folk</b> and <b>A Night in Acadie</b>, and an introduction and notes by Nina Baym."A Creole Bovary is this little novel of Miss Chopin's."<br>--Willa Cather</p><h2>Religious Freedom: The Contested History of an American Ideal</h2><p>Religious freedom is so often presented as a timeless American ideal and an inalienable right, appearing fully formed at the founding of the United States. That is simply not so, Tisa Wenger contends in this sweeping and brilliantly argued book. Instead, American ideas about religious freedom were continually reinvented through a vibrant national discourse--Wenger calls it "religious freedom talk--that cannot possibly be separated from the evolving politics of race and empire. <br><br>More often than not, Wenger demonstrates, religious freedom talk worked to privilege the dominant white Christian population. At the same time, a diverse array of minority groups at home and colonized people abroad invoked and reinterpreted this ideal to defend themselves and their ways of life. In so doing they posed sharp challenges to the racial and religious exclusions of American life. People of almost every religious stripe have argued, debated, negotiated, and brought into being an ideal called American religious freedom, subtly transforming their own identities and traditions in the process. In a post-9/11 world, Wenger reflects, public attention to religious freedom and its implications is as consequential as it has ever been.<br><br></p><p>Tisa Wenger, associate professor of American religious history at Yale University, is the author of <i>We Have a Religion: The 1920s Pueblo Indian Dance Controversy and American Religious Freedom</i>.Theoretically informed, brilliantly argued, clearly organized, carefully evidenced, beautifully written, and wonderfully textured, <i>Religious Freedom</i> is an important book. Exploring the triangulation of religion, race, and empire--and how they are mutually shaped--Tisa Wenger has advanced our understanding of the dilemma of religious freedom.--David Chidester, author of <i>Empire of Religion</i><br>Tisa Wenger has crafted a riveting account of how the Western deployment of religious freedom emerged within the immanent frame of empire. As she examines transnational networks of race, colonialism, and religion, Wenger elucidates the historical and theoretical conundrums of civilizing missions, Indigeneity, democratization, subaltern agencies, and modern terrors that have rendered freedom of religion as a global formation. This is surely the high-water mark of interdisciplinary scholarship on religious freedom, and it sets a new standard.--Sylvester Johnson, author of <i>African American Religions, 1500-2000</i><br>In this ambitious and impressive book, Tisa Wenger makes the compelling argument that American religious freedom is inseparable from the logics of race and empire.

I haven&#x2019;t tried freezer-paper templates before outside of foundation piecing, so I&#x2019;m excited to give it a go. After all, isn&#x2019;t a sampler supposed to be about building skills? I could use some practice with cutting and perfecting my points, so this is a good one to choose. Overall, I really recommend this book, and I&#x2019;m looking forward to seeing what everyone does with it! (<i>Right Sides Together, 12/16/14</i>)<br><br>Sampler quilts aren&#x2019;t unique to the modern quilting movement&#x2014;they&#x2019;ve been around for years&#x2014;but they&#x2019;re a growing trend in modern quilting, spurred on by popular books like Tula Pink&#x2019;s CitySampler. The basic premise: mix-and-match blocks with a cohesive aesthetic so quilters can take any combination and make a unique quilt. Hartman&#x2019;s (The Practical Guide to Patchwork) entry is ambitious&#x2014;75 blocks in three different sizes (a traditional 8" x 8" square, as well as rectangular blocks that finish at 5" x 8" and 5" x 14"). She provides three different examples of each block in three diverse color palettes, demonstrating how fabric choice can affect the finished block. The instructions are straightforward, and each block has its own cutting chart, as well as piecing diagrams as needed. The blocks vary in difficulty and techniques used range from simple straight-line piecing to freezer-paper-template piecing (pull-out pages are included). Six sample layouts are provided, each using a different combination of blocks and setting. VERDICT Hartman has name recognition among modern quilters, and, that, combined with the growing interest in sampler quilts, make this an excellent choice for quilting collections.

In this fourth volume of Johnstone's Eagles series, Jamie, patriarch of the hugely prolific clan that runs Valley, Colo., acts as little more than a Dirty Harry in buckskins, as likely to slaughter historical fact as he is to off his fellow humans. After his beloved wife is murdered by the Miles Nelson gang of cutthroats and robbers, Jamie vows to track down and kill every one of the cowardly outlaws. At 62, the frontiersman is as tough as a boiled owl, spry and still handy with his pistols, rifle and shotgun.Wasting no time, he wipes out the gang and, through a maze of poorly defined subplots, also pumps lead into bounty hunters, feuding families, crooked lawmen, hired assassins and several hapless smart alecks. Jamie even finds time to fight the Sioux with General Custer, miraculously surviving the Last Stand. This is a preposterous story, with little historical accuracy or value, featuring a shallow caricature of a western hero. Readers may note that Jamie never confronts Miles Nelson himself, no doubt saving the outlaw for a further bloodbath?though one wonders if it could possibly be as mindless as this. <br>Copyright 1996 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Fall of Light: Kharkanas Trilogy Book 2</h2><p><b><i>Fall of Light</i> is the second novel in the Kharkanas Trilogy.</b> <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a bitter winter and civil war now ravages Kurald Galain, as Urusander&#x2019;s Legion prepares to march upon the city of Kharkanas.The rebels&#x2019; only opposition lies scattered, bereft of a leader since Anomander&#x2019;s departure in search of his estranged brother, Andarist.

But bad fortune and his own prideful spirit have driven him from New York into artistic exile in Texas just after World War I. His adult daughter, Maureen, serves as his assistant, although she has artistic ambitions of her own and is beginning to understand how her own career&#x2014;perhaps even her life&#x2014;has become hostage to her driven father&#x2019;s &#x201c;wild pursuit of glory.&#x201d; When Lamar Clayton, an aging, heartbroken rancher, offers Gil a commission to create a memorial statue of his son Ben, who was killed in the war, Gil seizes the opportunity to create what he believes will be his greatest achievement.<br><br>As work proceeds on the statue, Gil and Maureen come to realize that their new client is a far more complicated man than he appeared to be on first acquaintance, and that Lamar is guarding a secret that haunts his relationship with his son even in death. But Gil is haunted as well: by the fear that his work will be forgotten and by an unconscionable lie whose discovery could cost him his daughter&#x2019;s love. The creation of the statue leads to a chain of dramatic encounters, through which Maureen will test the boundaries of her independence and Gil and Lamar, each in his own painful way, will confront their worth as fathers. <br><br><i>Remember Ben Clayton</i> vividly depicts a rich swath of American history, from the days when the Comanches ruled the Southern plains to the final brutal months of World War I. It ranges from outlaw settlements on the Texas frontier to the caf�s of Paris, from Indian encampments to artists&#x2019; ateliers to the forgotten battlefield in France where Ben Clayton died. It shows us the all-consuming labor that a monumental work of sculpture demands and the price it exacts from both artist and patron. And with unforgettable power and compassion it presents a deeply moving story about the bonds between fathers and children, and about the power and purpose of art.</p><p><b>Guest Reviewer: William Broyles</b> <br> <table> <tbody> <tr> <td> </td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <i><b>William Broyles</b> is the founding editor of </i>Texas Monthly<i> magazine, the screenwriter of </i>Cast Away<i> and eight other films, and the author of the Viet Nam memoir, </i>Brothers in Arms. <p></p> A sculptor determined to find truth in art, a young man seeking redemption from the terrible wounds of war, a young woman searching for freedom and love, and a father struggling for forgiveness--these memorably-drawn characters leap off the page in Stephen Harrigan&#x2019;s masterful novel <i>Remember Ben Clayton</i>. <p></p> Lamar Clayton is determined to build a memorial to his son, killed in a reckless charge in World War I. At first the commission seems straightforward, a way for ambitious sculptor Gil Gilheaney to leapfrog his New York peers and secure his artistic reputation. His daughter Maureen is his dutiful assistant, willing to sacrifice love and her own art to her father&#x2019;s single-minded search for greatness. Lamar Clayton is a broken-hearted old man who wants only to honor his son Ben, a golden boy and gifted horseman. <p></p> But in Harrigan&#x2019;s skillful hands nothing is so simple. Ben&#x2019;s death turns out to be a compelling mystery that transforms the lives of each character, and brings to the surface lies told and lies lived. The truth hides behind the disfigured face of Ben&#x2019;s wounded comrade, behind the tangled loyalties and brutal conflicts of the blood-soaked Texas frontier, behind the secrets Lamar and Gil both hide from their children. <p></p> I loved this book. I was mesmerized to discover whether the sins of the fathers would indeed be visited onto their children. Harrigan understands artists, cowboys, warriors and women; he brings them to life with unflinching but compassionate honesty. He writes about art and war with equal power and authority, but his portrayals of the small quiet decisions that form a life are just as powerful, and sometimes just as shocking, as the wrenching scenes of combat. <p></p> The riddle of Ben Clayton is a hypnotic mystery story, drawing the characters out of the their hiding places, forcing them to confront who they really are and what they really want. In <i>Remember Ben Clayton</i>, Harrigan unforgettably captures it all: loyalty and betrayal, the corrosive power of secrets held too tight, the mystery of art, the confusion of the battlefield, and above all the deeply human need to be valued and remembered. <p></p><b>Stephen Harrigan</b> is the author of seven previous books of fiction and nonfiction, including the novels <i>Challenger Park </i>and the <i>New York Times </i>best seller <i>The Gates of the Alamo. </i>A longtime writer for <i>Texas Monthly </i>and other magazines, he is also an award-winning screenwriter who has written many movies for television.

It is, without question, one of the truly great Christian books.</p><p>John Owen was born in 1616 in Stadhampton, Oxfordshire and died in Ealing, West London, in 1683. During his sixty-seven years he lived out a life full of spiritual experience, literary accomplishment, and national influence so beyond most of his peers that he continues to merit the accolade of 'the greatest British theologian of all time.'<br><br>Despite his other achievements, Owen is best famed for his writings. These cover the range of doctrinal, ecclesiastical and practical subjects. They are characterized by profundity, thoroughness and, consequently, authority. Andrew Thomson said that Owen 'makes you feel when he has reached the end of his subject, that he has also exhausted it.' Although many of his works were called forth by the particular needs of his own day they all have a uniform quality of timelessness. The Banner of Truth Trust has reprinted his <i>Works</i> in twenty-three volumes."Whenever I return to read Owen I find myself at least in part wondering why I spend time reading lesser things.<br><br>Part of the contemporary value of Owen's work lies in the way it gives us biblical teaching and principles that can be applied to what we observe in the life of the churches today. He provides the tools we need to be discerning Christians in an undiscerning world. In the pages that follow you will find yourself quarrying theological treasures, and spiritual and pastoral riches, from the Owen Goldmine." (Sinclair B. Ferguson ~ Associate Preacher, St. Peter's Free Church, Dundee)<br><br>"I assert unhesitatingly that the man who wants to study experimental theology will find no books equal to those of Owen for complete scriptural and exhaustive treatment of the subjects they handle. If you wish to study thoroughly the doctrine of sanctification I make no apology for strongly recommending Owen on the Holy Spirit". (J. C. Ryle ~ First Bishop of Liverpool (1816 - 1900))</p><h2>Dinner Of Herbs</h2><p>Book by Catherine Cookson</p><p>Cookson&#39;s rich tale, set in nineteenth-century Northumberland, follows the lives of Mary Ellen Lee, Hal Roystan and Roddy Greenbank. These three childhood friends are influenced by old Kate Makepeace&#39;s love and the Bannaman family&#39;s evil. Fate and hatred are palpable characters who affect not only these friends, but also their children. Reader Susan Jameson delivers an excellent presentation throughout this double-volume set. Her down-to-earth, crisp, British alto clearly distinguishes the characters and their emotions; she gives warmth and humor to old Kate&#39;s strong, dry voice. Jameson&#39;s finesse as a reader makes the listener eager to hear more of Cookson&#39;s compelling saga. J.A.H.

His masterwork, the <i>Book of Five Rings (Gorin no sho) </i>, is one of the most insightful texts on the subtle arts of confrontation and victory to emerge from Asian culture. <br>Over the centuries, Musashi's reputation has grown to mythic proportions, but, in fact, much about Musashi and his life remains a mystery. Here, Kenji Tokitsu, a modern martial arts master and scholar, turns a critical eye on Musashi's life and writings, separating fact from fiction, and providing a view of the man and his ideas that is accessible and relevant to today's readers and martial arts students. <br>Tokitsu provides a vivid and meticulously researched biography and a fresh translation of the <i>Book of Five Rings </i>, along with four other texts on strategy, all with extensive commentary. He is a thoughtful and informed guide, putting the historical and philosophical aspects of the text into context. <br>He also covers: <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The main periods in the history of Japanese swordsmanship <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Musahi's childhood and his first duel <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The founding of Musashi's School of Two Swords <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; Musashi's influence on contemporary practice <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;�&nbsp; The evolution of budo, or martial arts practice for self-cultivation<br>Musashi was also a respected artist, and this book contains color reproductions of his own calligraphies and paintings, with commentary by the well-known art historian Stephen Addiss.</p><p>Kenji Tokitsu was born in Japan and began studying martial arts when he was a child. He has taught karate in Paris since 1971. In 1984 he founded the Shaolin-mon school, where he teaches a synthesis of the original combat arts of Japan and China. In 2001 he established the Tokitsuryu Academy to teach and promote his method. For more information, visit www.tokitsu.com. Tokitsu also holds doctorates in sociology and in Japanese language and civilization. He is the author of numerous books."<i>Miyamoto Musashi </i> is a close look at the legendary swordsman and his treatises on swordsmanship and strategy by a Japanese martial artist.

He ruled constitutionally until 1925, when he dropped all pretense of democracy and set up a legal dictatorship. Known as Il Duce (The Leader), Mussolini was the founder of Italian Fascism. In 1912 Mussolini was the leading member of the National Directorate of the Italian Socialist Party (PSI). Prior to 1914, he was a keen supporter of the Socialist International, starting the series of meetings in Switzerland that organised the communist revolutions and insurrections that swept through Europe from 1917. Mussolini was expelled from the PSI for withdrawing his support for the party's stance on neutrality in World War I. He served in the Royal Italian Army during the war until he was wounded and discharged in 1917. Mussolini denounced the PSI, his views now centering on nationalism instead of socialism, and later founded the fascist movement. Following the March on Rome in October 1922 he became the youngest Prime Minister in Italian history until the appointment of Matteo Renzi in February 2014. After removing all political opposition through his secret police and outlawing labor strikes, Mussolini and his followers consolidated their power through a series of laws that transformed the nation into a one-party dictatorship. Within five years he had established dictatorial authority by both legal and extraordinary means, aspiring to create a totalitarian state. Mussolini remained in power until he was deposed by King Victor Emmanuel III in 1943. A few months later, he became the leader of the Italian Social Republic, a German client regime in northern Italy; he held this post until his death in 1945.</p><h2>Humanist Manifestos I and II</h2><p>This is a stirring document outlining a philosophy for survival and fulfilment in our time.

A Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature, he has published five collections of poetry and has received a number of honours, including the Petrarca-Preis, the E.M. Forster Award from the American Academy of Arts and Letters and all three Forward Prizes. His selected poems, Sailing the Forest, was published in 2014.The lyric poem, common to these times, can be said to contain a tiny story. Having held his readers in the grip of many small tales, Robin Robertson now launches into a full narrative telling, which is alive with the details of post-war American life as well as the jumpy subjective life of its protagonist. The Long Take will thrill you with its shadowy mysteries and cinematic intensity. -- Billy Collins The Long Take remarkably captures linguistic styles of 1940s American writing - Saroyan and Steinbeck. As it progresses into the mid-50s we're hearing Ginsberg and Baldwin...you will be washed in all these when you read this poem... Robertson has chosen a supremely uncomfortable, recognizable flashpoint in US history, an almost perfect mirror image of the nation today: crude, newly unleashed material ambitions mix with off-the-chart levels of fear and paranoia. The only difference is that then it was Russkies and immigrants, and now, uh . . . -- Todd McEwen * Sunday Herald * The Long Take shows it is perfectly possible to write poetry which is both accessible and subtle, which has a genuine moral and social conscience . . . Robertson manages a remarkable strike rate for keeping the language unsettling and honed, often by judicious assonance and alliterations . . . This is a major achievement and will linger long in the reader's mind -- Stuart Kelly * Scotsman * The words flow like the frames of a classic film masterpiece. -- Mike Hodges, filmmaker, <i>Get Carter</i>, <i>Croupier</i>, <i>I'll Sleep When I'm Dead</i> Robin Robertson is instantly recognisable as a poet of vivid authority, commanding a surprised, accurate language of his own. The evocative truth and the crystalline ring of his words, line by line, make a kind of hope in themselves. -- W.S. Merwin Robin Robertson is a fearless and thrilling poet. -- Marina Warner <b> </b> The Long Take is a bullet of a book. It is deeply noir, scything open post-war Los Angeles to show us a living, breathing city: a complicated social setting with cinema layered into its very fabric, a place growing at the expense of many of its most vulnerable citizens. It is a bold book - both imaginative and brave - but, more than that, it is a book that hits its target. It flies. It feels true. -- Ryan Gattis, author of <i>All Involved</i> <b><i> </i></b> Like all of Robertson's work, I approached The Long Take with great anticipation, for few writers so expertly pull the curtains back on the many collective fictions, both ancient and new, that constitute our understanding of the world. All of Robertson's extraordinary gifts as a writer are on display here: his probing intelligence and wit, the strangely tactile beauty of his lines, and his stubborn refusal to ignore all that lingers unaccounted for at the edges of our vision. I was genuinely bowled over by it. -- Kevin Powers, author of <i>The Yellow Birds</i> An inter-genre tour de force, The Long Take is a restless reimagining of conventional poetics. Through the poem's protagonist, Robertson has cast a national, cultural, psychological and class outsider of vibrant and seedy post-war America into a palpable anti-hero eerily resonant with our contemporary world. With syncopated rhythms, staccato dialogue and jump-scenes, the book weaves dizzying, jazz-like meditations on PTSD, masculinity, betrayal and salvation by embodying, in sound, scent and sixth-sense, one of America's most hopeful and devastating decades. The result is a ravishing achievement. -- Ocean Vuong, author of <i>Night Sky with Exit Wounds</i>, winner of the T.S. Eliot Prize <b> </b> Robin Robertson, one of the finest lyric poets of the age, flexes his artistic reach in a continuous narrative of more than two hundred pages, a beautiful, vigorous and achingly melancholy hymn to the common man that is as unexpected as it is daring. Here we have a poet, at the peak of his symphonic powers, taking a great risk, and succeeding gloriously... The Long Take is a masterly work of art, exciting, colourful, fast-paced - the old-time movie reviewer's vocabulary is apt to the case - and almost unbearably moving. -- John Banville * Guardian *</p><h2>Through Wolf&#39;s Eyes (Wolf, Book 1)</h2><p><p>Firekeeper only vaguely remembers a time when she didn't live with her "family," a pack of "royal wolves"-bigger, stronger, and smarter than normal wolves.

AAA-ROOO!</em><br>Distant, yet carrying, the wolf&#x2019;s howl broke the late-afternoon stillness. In the depths of the forest, a young woman, as T strong and supple as the sound, rose noiselessly to her feet. With bloodstained fingers, she pushed her short, dark brown hair away from her ears to better hear the call.<br><em>Aaa-rooo! Aaa-rooo!</em><br>It was a sentry howl, relayed from a great distance to the east. The young woman understood its message more easily than she would have understood any form of human speech.<br>"<em>Strangers! Strangers! Strangers! Strange!"</em><br>The last lilt of inflection clarified the previous howls. Whatever was coming from the east was not merely a trespasser&#x2014;perhaps a young wolf dispersing from his birth pack&#x2014;but an unknown quantity. But from the relay signal that preceded the call, the strangers were far away.<br>The young woman felt a momentary flicker of curiosity. Hunger, however, was more pressing. The cold times were not long past and her memories of dark, freezing days, when even the stupid fish were unreachable beneath the ice, were sharp.<br>She squatted again and continued skinning a still warm rabbit, musing, not for the first time, how much more convenient it would be if she could eat it as her kinfolk did: fur, bone, flesh, and guts all in one luxurious mouthful.<br>* * *<br><em>AAA-ROOO! AAA-ROOO!</em><br>Derian Carter, the youngest member of Earl Kestrel&#x2019;s expedition, felt his shoulder jerked nearly out of its socket when the wolf howl pierced the late-afternoon peace. The haunting sound startled the sensitive chestnut mare he was unbridling nearly out of her highly bred stockings.<br>"Easy, easy, Roanne," he murmured mechanically, all too aware that his own heart was racing. That wolf sounded <em>close!</em><br>As Derian eased the mare&#x2019;s headstall over ears that couldn&#x2019;t seem to decide whether to prick in alarm or flatten in annoyance, he said in a voice he was pleased to discover remained calm, almost nonchalant:<br>"That sounds like a big wolf out there, Race."<br>Race Forester, the guide for Earl Kestrel&#x2019;s expedition, looked down his long nose at the younger man and chuckled. He was a lean fellow with a strong, steady tread that spoke of long distances traveled afoot and blond hair bleached so white by constant exposure to the sun that he would look much the same at sixty as he did at thirty.<br>"That it does, Derian." Race stroked his short but full beard as he glanced around their sheltered forest camp, systematically noting the areas that would need to be secured now that big predators were about. "Wolves always sound bigger when you&#x2019;re on their turf, rather than safe behind a city wall."<br>Derian swallowed a retort. In the weeks since Earl Kestrel&#x2019;s expedition had departed the capital of Hawk Haven, Race had rarely missed an opportunity to remind the members (other than the earl himself) that Race himself was the woodsman, while they were mere city folk. Only the fact that Race&#x2019;s contempt was so generally administered had kept Derian from calling him out and showing him that a city-bred man could know a thing or two.<br>Only that, Derian admitted honestly (though only to himself), and the fact that Race would probably turn Derian into a smear on the turf. Though Derian Carter was tall enough to need to duck his head going through low doorways, muscular enough to handle the most spirited horse or work from dawn to dusk loading and unloading wagons at his father&#x2019;s warehouses, there was something about Race Forester&#x2019;s sinewy form, about the way he carried his slighter build, that made Derian doubt who would be the winner in a hand-to-hand fight.<br>And, with another surge of honesty, Derian admitted that the woodsman had earned the right to express his contempt. Race was good at what he did&#x2014;many said the best in both Hawk Haven and their rival kingdom of Bright Bay. What was Derian Carter in comparison? Well trained, but untried.<br>Derian would never have admitted that before they set out&#x2014;knowing himself good with a horse or an account book or even with his fists&#x2014;but a few things had been hammered into his red head since they left the capital, things that hadn&#x2019;t been all that much fun to learn, and Derian didn&#x2019;t plan on forgetting them now.<br>So Derian swallowed his retort and continued removing the tack from the six riding horses. To his right, burly Ox, his road-grown beard incongruously black against pink, round cheeks, was heaving the packs from the four mules. When another long, eerie wolf&#x2019;s howl caused the nearest mule to kick back at the imagined danger, Ox blocked the kick rather than dodging.<br>That block neatly summed up why Ox was a member of the expedition. Even-tempered, like most big men who have never been forced to fight, Ox had made his recent living in the Hawk Haven military. During the current lull in hostilities, however, he had left the military to serve as Earl Kestrel&#x2019;s bodyguard.<br>Ox&#x2019;s birth name, Derian had learned to his surprise, was Malvin Hogge.<br>"But no one&#x2019;s called me that since long before my hair started receding," he&#x2019;d told Derian, rubbing ruefully where his curly hairline was making an undignified and premature retreat. "But I prefer the name that my buddies in Kestrel Company gave me long ago and, strangely enough, no one ever calls me &#x2018;Malvin&#x2019; twice."<br>Unlike Derian, Ox felt no inordinate awe toward Race Forester, aware that in his own way he was as valuable as the guide. How many men could shift a battering ram by themselves or do the work of three packers?<br>"Think that wolf wants us for dinner?" Ox asked Race in his deep-voiced, ponderous way.<br>"Hardly," the guide retorted scornfully. "We&#x2019;re too big a group and wolves, savage as they are, are not stupid."<br>"Well," Ox replied, laughing at-his own joke, "you&#x2019;d better tell the mules that. I don&#x2019;t think they understand."<br>Sir Jared Surcliffe, a lesser member of Earl Kestrel&#x2019;s own family, but prouder of his recently acquired nickname "Doc" than of any trace of noble blood, crossed to claim the general provisions bundle. Like the earl he had black hair and clear, grey eyes, but his height and build lacked the earl&#x2019;s seeming delicacy. There was strength in his long-fingered hands&#x2014;as Derian had learned when Jared stitched a cut in his forearm a couple of weeks back. Derian recalled that Doc had won honors in battle, so he must have other strengths as well.<br>"Valet has the fire started," Jared said, an upper-class accent giving his simple statement unwonted authority. "I&#x2019;ll start dinner. Race, shouldn&#x2019;t you see if there might be a fish or two in yonder brook? Earl Kestrel would enjoy fresh trout with his dinner."<br>Had anyone but Jared or the earl himself even hinted at giving the guide orders, he might have found himself standing a late-night watch on an anthill. Race Forester, though, for all his pride in his skills, knew when he could&#x2014;and could not&#x2014;push his social betters.<br>"Right," he grunted, and departed, whistling for Queenie, his bird dog. The red-spotted hound reluctantly abandoned the station near the fire from which she&#x2019;d been watching Earl Kestrel&#x2019;s man unpack the delicacies kept for the earl&#x2019;s own consumption.<br>When the wolf howled again, Derian wondered how much of Queenie&#x2019;s reluctance was due to leaving the food and how much to the proximity of the big predator.<br>"They say that the wolves in the mountains are bigger than anything found in settled lands," Derian said, talking to distract himself and feeling</strong></p></p><h2>Forbidden Pleasure (Bound Hearts, Book 8)</h2><p><p>People have heard of fleeting rumors about The Club.

Presumably Borden's younger daughter Lizzie and an Irish servant woman were the only other people in the house. Lizzie was tried for the murders and acquitted, supposedly closing the case. But speculations about the Fall River murders have refused to subside, prompting dozens of books, short stories, plays, an opera and even a ballet, many of these offering alternative conjectures about the killer. This carefully researched book is one of the best ever done on the case. The late Kent, an actor and fiction writer, lays out the flimsy evidence and comments impartially on the court testimony, making it clear that the verdict of not guilty was justified. And, perhaps uniquely among the writers about the case, Kent presents no theory about mysterious strangers, disgruntled former employees or estranged relatives. He simply confesses, convincingly, that he has no idea who committed the crime--except that it was not Lizzie Borden. Photos. <br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.It is known with certainty that Andrew and Abby Borden were killed in 1892. All else is conjecture. Arnold Braun's Lizzie Borden ( LJ 8/91) presented yet another theory of who the killer might have been, and now Kent reveals new evidence about the case, although he does not point to a suspect. History will not be changed by Kent's findings or by any of the plethora of books commemorating the 100th anniversary of the deed. Still, Forty Whacks gives a good presentation of the social history of the time. It also shows Lizzie as she probably was instead of the way the late Victorian tabloids portrayed her. Kent gives good, crisp images of the main characters and their motives, including those who perjured themselves. The book succeeds best when the author narrates and is less successful when relying on trial transcripts. Overall, though, it is a balanced addition to the body of literature on the Borden murders.

He has written for Playboy, Details, and Rolling Stone, and lives in Mill Valley, California.As the nation-state fades into history's rearview mirror, muscled out of the express lane by corporations that can move money faster than governments can make policies, natural disasters that know no national boundaries, and religions that claim higher authority, historians look for new ways to understand the past. One that has lately drawn attention is the commodity. During the past decade, books on the potato, the cod and even salt have attracted big audiences by offering new ways to think about history. With Big Cotton, Steven Yafa adds another to the list, employing a playwright's sense of drama to show how cotton was woven into the American experience. <p>With wit and intelligence, Yafa demonstrates how a good deal of history can be learned by following a single thread. While his puns -- like that one -- are generally unfortunate, his ambitious narrative energetically summarizes the approximately 5,000 years from cotton's domestication to the latest genetically modified boll. Just about "everyone on the planet," he rightly notes, wears cotton and, in its various by-products, eats cotton, sleeps on cotton, sweats in cotton, washes with cotton and lives in cotton. We talk cotton -- spinning yarns, weaving plots and knitting brows. We even spend with cotton -- as cotton-based paper has become the standard upon which modern currencies are printed. The American greenback is some three-quarters cotton. After noting that cotton "truly belongs to the world," Yafa turns his attention to the United States.</p><p>Beginning with 17th-century English settlements, Yafa moves quickly from the fields to the spinning wheel and then from the factory floor to the department store. He pauses briefly in the middle of the 19th century to view the role of King Cotton in the coming of the Civil War but then quickly moves on to the transformation of plantation hands and yeoman farmers into sharecroppers who grew the cotton and lintheads who spun it into cloth. He bows to the boll weevil, curtsies before the bobbin, salutes the mechanical cotton picker, and hurries off to the laboratories, which developed new seeds, fertilizers and fabrics.</p><p>But Big Cotton is more than a breathless tour through the American past, where endless vignettes about the fleecy white tuffs bracket equally endless enumerations of bales grown and bolts sold. Yafa peoples his history with the larger-than-life Arkwrights, Whitneys, Cones and Strausses. The critical innovations these men, their families, and business associates made to the cultivation, manufacture and marketing of cotton transformed gossypium and humanity with it. Leadbelly, James Dean, Ogilvy &amp; Mather and countless others make cameo appearances, by turns singing about cotton, wearing cotton and selling cotton. Yafa also imbues his narrative with moral weight. Cotton provided some men and women with previously unimagined wealth and power and reduced many more to grinding poverty and even more dismal servitude. The conflicts these distinctions set in motion between workers and bosses, masters and slaves, can hardly match their grim consequences. Seventy percent of the first workers to enter the cotton mills in Lowell, Mass., died of respiratory illness, later diagnosed as byssinosis, or brown lung disease. Their contemporaries who labored in the cotton fields of Alabama and Mississippi had no need to fear such lingering deaths, as their end came more swiftly and often more violently. Whether they worked for the lords of the loom or the lords of the lash, men and women -- not to mention millions of children -- who worked in the cotton industry were driven to an early death after a short, harsh existence. Later, the terms changed between those who sucked in lint in the factories and succumbed to brown lung and those who absorbed DDT in the fields and perished from multiple carcinogens, although their demise was equally certain. Yafa emphasizes that cotton was not simply a matter of wealth and poverty; it was life and death.</p><p>But having bound the American past in the ubiquity of cotton, Yafa overextends its power, suggesting that cotton's special properties distinctively endowed the human, the American and even his own personal experience. Since cotton is "too valuable . . . to inspire only noble behavior, and too easily grown to invite self restraint, [it] lends itself to greed, opportunism, hypocrisy, irrational passion, attempted murder, and episodes of brilliant creativity." For Yafa, cotton encouraged the special openness, extraordinary inventiveness and rambunctious opportunism that once elevated his native Lowell to wealth and prominence and then dispatched it to the depth of poverty and marginality. </p><p>Yet much the same can be said of every other commodity from sugar to tulips, for they too -- at one time or another -- inspired greed, irrationality and brilliant creativity. Like them, cotton has no volition. Contrary to Yafa's title, cotton did not create fortunes, wreck civilizations or put America on the map. Rather -- like the potato, the cod and salt -- cotton was indifferent to human desires, whether high or low. If homespun rubbed some raw, it inspired others. If percale soothed some, it irritated others. The motor of history cannot be found in cotton, no matter how dense the thread count.</p><p>Reviewed by Ira Berlin <br>Copyright 2005, The Washington Post Co.

But as Ken Hughes reveals in his powerful new book, in all the thousands of hours of declassified White House tapes, the president orders a single break-in--and it is not at the Watergate complex. Hughes&#x2019;s examination of this earlier break-in, plans for which the White House ultimately scrapped, provides a shocking new perspective on a long history of illegal activity that prolonged the Vietnam War and was only partly exposed by the Watergate scandal.</p><p>As a key player in the University of Virginia&#x2019;s Miller Center Presidential Recordings Program, Hughes has spent more than a decade developing and mining the largest extant collection of transcribed tapes from the Johnson and Nixon White Houses. Hughes&#x2019;s unparalleled investigation has allowed him to unearth a pattern of actions by Nixon going back long before 1972, to the final months of the Johnson administration. Hughes identified a clear narrative line that begins during the 1968 campaign, when Nixon, concerned about the impact on his presidential bid of the Paris peace talks with the Vietnamese, secretly undermined the negotiations through a Republican fundraiser named Anna Chennault. Three years after the election, in an atmosphere of paranoia brought on by the explosive appearance of the Pentagon Papers, Nixon feared that his treasonous--and politically damaging--manipulation of the Vietnam talks would be exposed. Hughes shows how this fear led to the creation of the Secret Investigations Unit, the "White House Plumbers," and Nixon&#x2019;s initiation of illegal covert operations guided by the Oval Office. Hughes&#x2019;s unrivaled command of the White House tapes has allowed him to build an argument about Nixon that goes far beyond what we think we know about Watergate.</p> <p> <i>Chasing Shadows</i> is also available as a special e-book that links to the massive collection of White House tapes published by the Miller Center through Rotunda, the electronic imprint of the University of Virginia Press. This unique edition allows the reader to move seamlessly from the book to the recordings&#x2019; expertly rendered transcripts and to listen to audio files of the remarkable--and occasionally shocking--conversations on which this dark chapter in American history would ultimately turn.</p><p></p></p><p><p>Ken Hughes is a researcher at the University of Virginia&#x2019;s Miller Center Presidential Recordings Program.

In this groundbreaking and now-classic volume, the authors present haiku poets writing in English, Spanish, French, German, and five other languages on an equal footing with Japanese poets. Not only are the four great Japanese masters of the haiku represented (Basho, Buson, Issa, and Shiki) but also major Western authors not commonly known to have written poetry in this form, including Gary Snyder, Jack Kerouac and Richard Wright. <br> <br>With a new foreword by poet, translator, and author Jane Reichhold (<em>Basho: The Complete Haiku</em>), this anniversary edition presents a concise history of the Japanese haiku, including the dynamic changes throughout the twentieth century as this beloved poetry form has been adapted to modern and urban settings. Full chapters are offered on form, the seasons in haiku, and haiku craft, plus background on the Japanese poetic tradition and the effect of translation on our understanding of haiku. Other unique features are chapters on teaching and sharing haiku, with lesson plans for both elementary and secondary school use; a seasonal word index of poetic words; a comprehensive glossary; and a list of enduring classic resources for further exploration. By any standard, <em>The Haiku Handbook </em>is the defining volume in the genre.</p><p><br>WILLIAM J. HIGGINSON (1938-2008) has been called "the guru of American haiku." For over 40 years, Higginson translated, wrote, commented about, lectured and taught haiku.

Perhaps it is the funnies flapping in the breeze before a newsstand on a sunny spring day. Or some scent on the wind catches us as we step from the bus, or bend to lift the groceries from the car. Something tickles our ankle and, looking down to see what it is, we see more: </p><p>a baby crab<br> climbs up my leg--<br> such clear water </p><p>Or we are lying awake, alone with our thoughts, and as we turn to look at the clock </p><p>at midnight<br> a distant door<br> pulled shut </p><p>and we find ourselves more alone, because of the being on the other side of that door, than when we had no thoughts for others anywhere in the world. </p><p>The first of these two short poems was written about three hundred years ago by the Japanese poet Matsuo Basho. The second is by a twentieth-century Japanese poet, Ozaki Hosai. Both poems are haiku. </p><p>Moments that can give rise to haiku are not foreign to the Americas.

The Seeker learns how to make better decisions to help his children avoid doing the dumb things he has done. For instance, he learns from Buffett and Munger the best way to prevent trouble is to avoid it altogether by learning what works and what does not. They do so in the spirit of the anonymous man who said: &#34;All I want to know is where I&#39;m going to die so I&#39;ll never go there.&#34; Additionally, the book provides examples of pure folly and some lessons on how to make fewer dumb mistakes than other people. And then how to fix mistakes faster, should you make them. The major lesson is &#34;ignorance removal&#34; and the notion that decision-making is not about making brilliant decision, but avoiding terrible ones. This is not a book for those who like complexities or advanced math - rather it&#39;s for those who love efficiency, simplicity and common sense or judgment - hallmarks of Buffett and Munger. Like Einstein, both have a remarkable ability to eliminate folly and superficiality and get directly to the heart of things.

Thirty years after Kennedy was murdered, he is still remembered, along with other great liberal contemporaries such as Martin Luther King Jr. and John F. Kennedy, as a tragic crusader for liberalism. To liberals, Bobby Kennedy was their last champion of social reform and civil rights; when he died, their pursuit of these aims took a mortal blow. So when Beran intimates that on the day Kennedy was killed, it wasn't a Rooseveltian idealist who died, but rather a man who was essentially a conservative practitioner of liberal politics, it is bound to create controversy amongst his staunchest supporters. <p> To them, Kennedy was "a rare example of a liberal icon," which is why political liberals might be antagonized by Beran's argument. It is to Beran's credit that he persuasively and passionately backs up his points, carefully illustrating popular misconceptions about Kennedy. He explores the so-called liberal policies instigated by Kennedy, and concludes that these were really little more than timely suggestions and tentative actions, rather than bold policy moves. He chronicles Kennedy's drive toward conservative statesmanship, epitomized by his understanding of public service. Kennedy seemed to understand that success in the modern political arena meant blending liberal policies with a conservative support system, a vision of politics that can be seen in modern-day politicians such as Bill Clinton. </p><p> In tracing this evolution of thought, Beran illustrates Kennedy's maturation from arrogant aristocrat to responsible, benevolent crusader whose compassionate actions were driven more by his own misfortunes than by liberal morals. At a time when other books are revising public opinion of the Kennedy compound, focusing on the darker side of their affairs, this is a respectful and thoughtful work that subtly reminds us just how much was lost the day Robert Kennedy was shot down in his prime. <i>--Jeremy Storey</i></p>"[Beran] is such a lively writer, and such a risk-taking thinker, that the sparks he promiscuously strikes from his literary flint are, cumulatively, illuminating.... Beran's slender meditation on Kennedy's truncated life has an unusually high ration of provocations per page. Some readers will angrily throw it across the room. But they will retrieve it, and continue reading, avidly." --George F. Will, <i>The New York Times Book Review</i><p> "A remarkable achievement...It offers new insights into the character of Robert Kennedy, perhaps the most enigmatic public figure of our time." --William Manchester</p><p> "Beran has written an enigmatic little book about an enigmatic American giant....

Over six million of her books are in print and she is published in a dozen foreign countries. <br>Martin's (Silk and Steel) run-of-the-mill historical set in 1805 England and the Cape Verde Islands is strictly for readers who prefer their plot subordinate to steamy scenes. In lieu of creating a believable relationship between Randall Clayton, duke of Beldon, and Cait Harmon, an American, the author substitutes pages of hot, exceedingly repetitious sex scenes and a weak plot concerning an expedition to a deserted island to find the fabled necklace Antony gave Cleopatra. Needing to fund the expedition, Cait's father relies on a dubious baron/con artist whose previous business venture led to the death of Beldon's cousin. Is Cait's father part of the con? There's a lot of dangerous trekking through jungle to shake up the limping plot, but the padded writing is just a means to jungle seductions and dangers. How many times can the hero save the heroine from rock slides and wild animals? And can this relationship between two immature individuals, based on hot sex and inane secrets, be saved?

It is a volume that deserves to be called definitive.<br> Assembled and edited by Leon Edel, James's much-acclaimed prizewinning biographer, and Lyall H. Powers, critic and editor of James's letters to Edith Wharton, this book includes the nine scribbler-notebooks that were published by Oxford in 1947; these have been considerably updated and annotated to correct the identification of stories developed by James from his various notes and to reveal many noted Victorians James concealed through use of their initials. Certain omitted portions of the notebooks have also been restored.<br> This volume is especially noteworthy for the body of new material that it contains. It includes a series of James's pocket diaries in which, amid appointments and luncheon dates, he jotted down observations and ideas for his fiction and commented on his personal relations. Also here are some fugitive dictated notes, in which James offered an autobiographcial meditation on the "turning Point in his life and the "working out" of a story based on a passion murder by an American acquaintance in the south of France.<br> James's long out-of-print statements for his unfinished novels <em>The Ivory Tower</em> and <em>The Sense of the Past</em>, scenarios for unfinished plays, the writer's deathbed dictation--all these are here as well. An appendix includes a substantial fragment of a story James never completed, and the book even provides insight into James's "cash accounts." Everywhere throughout the collection, in writings never intended for the public eye, the artist is seen at work. his private prayers to his Muse and exhortations to himself make exhilarating reading.</p><p><br><em>About the Editors</em>:<br> <strong>Leon Edel</strong> is the author of <em>Life of Henry James</em> which received numerous awards, including the Pulitzer Prize, the National Book Award, and the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Arts and Letters.<br> <strong>Lyall H.

Beginning in the 10th century, Buddhists in the Western Himalayas traveled to Kashmir to acquire, preserve and emulate its sophisticated art. Kashmiri artists also accepted invitations to travel to the Western Himalayas during this period to work with and teach local artists. The distinctive workmanship of the Kashmiri style became integrated into the identity of Tibetan Buddhism in this period and experienced a revival in the Western Himalayas in the 15th and 16th centuries. Centuries later, beginning in the 1900s, artworks from Kashmir and the Western Himalayas became prized acquisitions for collections in the U.S. and Europe. Western explorers, scholars and travelers removed these works -- often surreptitiously -- from their places of origin. Today many of these works reside in public and private collections. Collecting Paradise features Buddhist objects, including manuscripts, paintings, and sculptures in ivory, metal and wood, dating from the 7th to 17th centuries. With 44 objects, the exhibition presents an original and innovative look at art from the region of Kashmir and the Western Himalayas, as well as how it has been collected over time. The catalogue features essays by a leading scholar in the field, Robert Linrothe, associate professor of art history in Northwestern s Weinberg College of Arts and Sciences, with the support of Christian Luczanits, the David L. Snellgrove Senior Lecturer in Tibetan and Buddhist Art at The School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS), University of London.</p><p></p><h2>Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (Focus on the Family&#39;s Classic Collection, 2)</h2><p>For Ingest Only - Data needs to be cleaned up for all products being loaded</p><p>This classic novel, subtitled A Tale of the Crist, has fascinated readers for generations with its vivid depictions of Jesus&#39; life interwoven with the fictional story of Judah Ben-Hur, a young Jew who finds his life inexorably changed by the Messiah.One of the most popular American novels of all time, General Lew Wallace's <i>Ben-Hur</i> vividly reimagines the mighty Roman Empire and the rise of Christianity. The saga of Judah Ben-Hur's spiritual journey from slavery to vengeance to redemption is both a vivid historical adventure and a powerful story of one man's religious awakening. As Blake Allmendinger writes in his Introduction to this Modern Library Paperback Classic, "<i>Ben-Hur </i>has endured for more than one hundred years because it offers something for everyone. The story of the Jewish hero Ben-Hur, his conflict with the Roman warrior Messala, and his conversion to Christianity at the foot of the Cross, combines adventure, sentimentality, athletic spectacle, and religious devotion."</p><h2>Le Voyageur sans Bagage suivi de Le Bal des Voleurs (Collection Folio) (French Edition)</h2><p>These original plays and novels accompanied by French-English vocabularies and a variety of pedagogical apparatus, are appropriate as intermediate or advanced readers.</p><p>Jean Anouilh was born in Bordeaux in 1910 and lived for many years in Switzerland until his death in 1987.

Amy is terrified. She hears scratching and scurrying noises coming from the dollhouse, and the dolls she was playing with are not where she left them. Dolls can&#39;t move by themselves, she tells herself. But every night when Amy goes into the attic to check on the dollhouse, it is filled with an eerie light and the dolls have moved again! Are the dolls trying to tell her something? Are their movements connected to grisly murders of her own great-grandparents?</p><p>Betty Ren Wright is the best-selling author of many books for children, inclduing &#34;The Dollhouse Murders&#34; and &#34;Christina&#39;s Ghost&#34;, both of which received the Texas Bluebonnet Award. She live in Racine, Wisconsin.What if there were a grisly double murder in your family&#39;s past? What if that unsolved murder were a dark family secret uncovered by furtive sleuthing? Carol Jordan Stewart offers a fast-paced narration of 12-year-old Amy&#39;s story as she struggles with a concealed past and a terrifying present. Stewart&#39;s unimpassioned delivery of Amy&#39;s Aunt Claire is perfectly suited to the emotionally controlled woman who has hidden the pain of her parents&#39; murders for more than thirty years. And Stewart&#39;s superb reading of Amy&#39;s developmentally delayed sister, Luanne, employs the cadences and innocence befitting such a character. Pacing is used effectively during scenes of high tension while bars of ominous music introduce each tape and set the mood for a mystery kids will thrill to. T.B.

Those who participated in the Fund were required to waive their right to sue the airlines involved in the attacks, as well as other potentially responsible entities. When the program was launched, many families criticized it as a brazen, tight-fisted attempt to protect the airlines from lawsuits. The Fund was also attacked as attempting to put insulting dollar values on the lives of lost loved ones. The families were in pain. And they were angry.<p> Over the course of the next three years, Feinberg spent almost all of his time meeting with the families, convincing them of the generosity and compassion of the program, and calculating appropriate awards for each and every claim. The Fund proved to be a dramatic success with over 97% of eligible families participating. It also provided important lessons for Feinberg, who became the filter, the arbitrator, and the target of family suffering. Feinberg learned about the enduring power of family grief, love, fear, faith, frustration, and courage. Most importantly, he learned that no check, no matter how large, could make the families and victims of 9/11 whole again.</p></p><p><b>Kenneth R. Feinberg</b>, one of the nation's leading lawyers, has been front and center in some of the most complex public legal disputes of the past three decades: Agent Orange, asbestos, the closing of the Shoreham Nuclear Plant, and now, 9/11. A former prosecutor and member of two Presidential Commissions, he is also adjunct Professor of Law at Georgetown University, the University of Pennsylvania, Columbia University, and New York University.<i>Starred Review.</i> When Feinberg writes that "[t]he cacophony of arguments validated my original preference: to refuse to evaluate individual suffering" midway through this frank memoir, the reader already trusts him enough to know that he is not being crass or unfeeling: he is being honest. By then, Feinberg, a lawyer who has been on two presidential commissions and has done Agent Orange litigation, has established his judicious forthrightness and his dedication to "the success of the fund"&#x2014;getting as many families as possible to opt in to the trust, which he headed and which was established to award cash to the 9/11 victims, rather than sue the government. The problem: how, and how much? Feinberg's willingness to put himself into the book makes what could have been an alternately dry and self-serving case study crackle with care, frustration, intellectual energy and good writing. Feinberg and his team ran through every argument and counterargument for compensation and its various possible permutations, and he presents the debate, and his ultimate conclusions as head of the 9/11 fund, with an earned conviction and clarity, even on stat-heavy pages. With its combination of a strong personality, undeniably compelling subject matter and a great title, this understated, passionate trek into the dismal terrain is likely to be a major surprise bestseller. Anything but macabre, it ends up, in its own way, celebrating life. <i>(June 13)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Following King's assassination, Abernathy took up the leadership of the SCLC's Poor People's Campaign and led the march on Washington in May 1968.</p>Abernathy's autobiographical account of the birth and struggles of the civil rights movement is inspirational and deeply moving. With Martin Luther King Jr., his closest colleague, he helped organize the 1955 Montgomery bus boycott and the 1965 march in Selma, Ala.; he and King went north to Chicago in 1966, where they battled Mayor Richard Daley and found racism as endemic and deep-rooted as in the South. He cradled King in his arms when the latter was assassinated in Memphis. Son of a stern, righth- ous farmer father, Abernathy became a Baptist pastor after fighting in WW II with a segregated platoon. In a voice at once down-to-earth and eloquent, he recounts protests, jailings and bombings in Birmingham, St. Augustine, Washington, Charleston and elsewhere. He defends his support of Reagan's 1980 presidential bid, as well as his support, in the next two elections, for Jesse Jackson. Reading this engrossing, powerful memoir-as-history will force white Americans to confront the legacy of racism. Abernathy conveys a sense of how the civil rights movement discovered its tactics and direction in response to individual situations.

Harry Behn establishes the spooky mood--"Tonight is the night/When dead leaves fly. . .", and Livingston takes courageous readers past the "jagged-tooth faces" of jack-o'-lanterns, trick-or-treating apes, ghosts and astronauts, a "Tink, plonk, konkle;/Midnight/Wind-chime" skeleton, up to a magic house with "chocolate doorknobs,/And windowpanes striped with mint" and even into a wicked witch's kitchen--"You're in the mood for freaky food?/ You feel your taste buds itchin'. . .?" Two-thirds of the poems appear here for the first time. Disembodied mouths, mad, disfigured faces, and leering pumpkin heads loom from the misty background in Gammell's weedy, black-and-white illustrations. Even such innocuous activities as "Bobbing for (blub blub) for apples" take on a sinister air--if readers make the mistake of looking too closely at the "apples."

Dan Clark, one of the world&#39;s leading inspirational speakers and leadership trainers, vehemently opposes the conventional wisdom about success.

How many outwardly successful people still feel empty inside?

Fact: The United States shot down several flying disks in the late 1940s, a period marked by an unprecedented wave of unexplained aircraft crashes.</p><p>The facts have continued only to mount over the past six decades in the classified files of military and intelligence agencies worldwide. Pilots the world over have reported incidents with UFOs that have often been accompanied by electrical interference and communications difficulties. UFOs have prompted more secrecy and security-and deception-than any other concern ever on the part of military specialists and intelligence chiefs around the world. An acknowledged authority on the controversial subject of UFOs, and an indefatigable researcher, Timothy Good in this revelatory book tells us what we need to know.</p></p><p>Timothy Good is one of the world&#x2019;s leading experts on alien phenomena. He has lectured at the Pentagon and the French Air Force and also acted as consultant for several U.S. congressional investigations. Tim is most recently the author of Need to Know. He lives in england.integrity, his determination and skill as a researcher, and his wide and detailed knowledge of the whole fascinating UFO experience. --Lord defense<br><br><p>The evidence that Good has amassed is too overwhelming to ignore and it is clear that a more open debate is long overdue.</p><br><br><p>An obsessively researched look at what British sky-watcher Good (<em>Alien Contact</em>, 1993, etc.) deems ample international evidence of UFO visitations since the 1930s, and the repeated official denials that they ever happened. "UFOs are as real as the airplanes that fly over your head," declared former Canadian Minister of Defence Paul Hellyer in 2005. Good methodically lays out similar testimony from pilots, military men in air and sea, civilian observers, surgeons who operated on the extraterrestrials, generals and presidents, accompanying their words (some from sworn affidavits) with meticulous footnotes, photos, drawings and copies of documents. During World War II, small, seemingly remote-controlled flying objects dubbed "foo-fighters" created a nuisance for pilots. In the summer of 1946, a rash of sightings of "ghost rockets" across Scandinavia and other parts of Europe alarmed the U.S. military, which blamed them on the Soviets. Good believes UFO incursions were common in 1940s New Mexico, the site of U.S. atomic testing, and avers that the debris found near Roswell in 1947, quickly identified by the military as fragments from a military balloon, was in fact the remains of a flying-saucer crash. He chronicles alien-disc sightings during the Cold War, suggests that Presidents Eisenhower and Kennedy were taken to disc-landing sites and maintains that since the 1940s, aliens have been communicating "with an elite group of U.S. military and scientific intelligence personnel [and] there has been a project was actually motivated by growing concerns about alien hostility, the author adds. The bizarre crash of a cigar-shaped craft near Varginha, Brazil, in January 1996 stranded strange creatures needing medical attention. Good excerpts some chilling material from an interview conducted by a fellow UFOlogist with comments are conflated into quotes collectively attributed to "Medical Personnel." The author certainly knows his stuff, and to his credit is keenly aware of the importance of documentation, however specious some of it may seem to the unconverted.</p><br><br><p>In this exhaustive and provocative polemic, Good (<em>Above Top Secret</em>, <em>Alien Liaison</em>), UFO researcher extraordinaire, endeavors to demonstrate that incontrovertible proof of UFOs is being buried by a global conspiracy of governments, academia and the media. Good catalogues hundreds of sightings of unidentified flying objects from the 1920s through the present and marshals scores of declassified government reports, news stories and eyewitness affidavits to support his often-controversial contentions: not only are aliens here, but the U.S. military has established contact with them; President Eisenhower met with aliens in 1954 at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.; President Kennedy viewed alien bodies at an air force medical facility in Florida; President Nixon arranged for comedian Jackie Gleason to view alien bodies in 1973. Good emphasizes a lengthy record of credible witnesses, including military and airline pilots, who have reported unexplained phenomena, but he fails to provide incontrovertible evidence of UFOs, extraterrestrials or a global conspiracy of secrecy. Moreover, he ignores contradictory testimony, exaggerates rumors and circumstantial evidence, and reprises old charges. Nonetheless, UFO enthusiasts will appreciate this comprehensive and spirited UFO defense and the hundreds of supporting documents reproduced within.</p><br><br><p><em>Above Top Secret</em> is a bible for UFO watchers.</p></p><h2>We Were One: Shoulder to Shoulder with the Marines Who Took Fallujah</h2><p><i>The platoon included four pairs of best friends. Each of the four would lose a best friend forever.</i>Five months after being deployed to Iraq, Lima Company's 1st Platoon found itself in Fallujah, embroiled in some of the most intense house-to-house, hand-to-hand combat since World War II. Civilians were used as human shields or as bait to lure soldiers into buildings rigged with explosives; suicide bombers approached from every corner hoping to die and take Americans with them; radical insurgents, high on adrenaline, fought to the death. The Marines of the 1st Platoon (part of 3rd Battalion, 1st Marine Regiment) were among the first to fight in Fallujah, and they bore the brunt of this epic battle. When it was over, the platoon had suffered thirty-five casualties, including four dead.This is their story.Award-winning author and historian Patrick O'Donnell stood shoulder-to-shoulder with this modern band of brothers as they marched and fought through the streets of Fallujah, and he stayed with them as the casualties mounted. O'Donnell captures not only the sights, sounds, and smells of the gritty street combat, but also the human drama of young men in a close-knit platoon fighting for their lives-and the lives of their buddies. We Were One chronicles the 1st Platoon's story, from its formation at Camp Pendleton in California to its near destruction in the smoldering ruins of Fallujah.<i>We Were One</i> is an unforgettable portrait of the new Greatest Generation.&#x201d;With 16 pages of extraordinary photographs from the front lines of the Battle for Fallujah.</p><p>"Here in these gripping pages is the Iraq War's fiercest battle, seen from the adrenaline-charged vantage of a few Marine buddies who are part of the next "Greatest Generation." <i>We Were One</i> is feelingly narrated by an intrepid war historian who risked his own life to capture every raw minute of their story."--Hampton Sides, author of <i>Blood and Thunder</i> and <i>Ghost Soldiers</i><p> "A magnificent tale of combat--mixing valor, grit, love, blood and sacrifice. This book defines what it means to be a Marine grunt."--Bing West, author of <i>The March Up </i> and <i>No True Glory</i></p><p> "<i>We Were One</i> is a dramatic tale of courage, hardship and the extraordinarily difficult challenges faced by a gallant Marine unit in one of the world's most deadly places. Patrick O'Donnell brilliantly and compassionately recounts the story of our American sons called upon to fight, bleed, die, and survive in a hostile land."--Carlo D'Este, author of <i>Patton: A Genius For War</i></p><p> "Pat O'Donnell was with us on the ground in Fallujah--house to house. His story is historically accurate and describes the greatest personal and professional test of our lives. <i>We Were One</i> is destined to be a classic of urban close combat, and honors the memory of all who made the ultimate sacrifice for their brother Marines. I am deeply thankful that Pat kept his oath to Lima Company."--LtCol Willy Buhl, CO Task Force 3/1, Operation AL FAJR</p><p> "As an embedded journalist in an Infantry Platoon, O'Donnell paints an authentic picture of our Nation's most precious assets--the Marine Riflemen--engaged in one of their fiercest fights. <i>We Were One</i> is a gritty, boots-on-the-ground account that enables readers to witness the overwhelming will and courage of Marines as they move against the enemy."--J.N.

Her historical novels have charmed and delighted millions of readers for decades, though she rarely reached out to the public to discuss her works or private life. She was born in Wimbledon in August 1902. She wrote her first novel, The Black Moth, at the age of seventeen to amuse her convalescent brother; it was published in 1921 and became an instant success.</p> <p> Heyer published 56 books over the next 53 years, until her death from lung cancer in 1974.

Known as the Queen of Regency romance, Heyer was legendary for her research, historical accuracy and her extraordinary plots and characterizations. Her last book, My Lord John, was published posthumously in 1975. She was married to George Ronald Rougier, a barrister, and they had one son, Richard.</p><p><b>One</b></p> <p>Silence had reigned over the dining-room since his lordship, midway through the first course, had harshly commanded his widowed daughter-in-law to spare him any more steward's room gossip. As Mrs Darracott had merely been recounting to her daughter the tale of her activities that day the snub might have been thought unjust, but she accepted it, if not with equanimity, with a resignation born of custom, merely exchanging a droll look with her daughter, and directing one of warning at her handsome young son. The butler glanced menacingly at the younger of the two footmen, but the precaution was unnecessary: Charles had not been employed at Darracott Place above six months, but he was not such a whopstraw as to make the least noise in the performance of his duties when his lordship was out of humour. That was the way Chollacombe described as knaggy an old gager as ever Charles had had the ill-fortune to serve. Stiff-rumped, that's what he was, always nabbing the rust, or riding grub, like he had been for months past.</p> <p>Charles had thought himself lucky to have been taken on at Darracott Place, but he wasn't going to stay above his twelvemonth, not if he knew it! It might suit James, being Kentish born, to work in a great, rambling house stuck down miles from anywhere, in a marsh flat and bare enough to give anyone a fit of the blue devils, and with never a soul, outside the Family, coming next or nigh it, but when Charles went after another place he was going to London. Let alone he was always one for a bit of life, you could earn extra gelt in London, for there were always errands to be run, or notes to be delivered, and you got a shilling every time you were sent off to execute such commissions. If messages had to be carried in the country it stood to reason they were taken by one of the grooms; while as for the throng of open-fisted guests his Dad had told him it would be his duty to wait upon well, a houseful of guests might have been what his Dad was used to in his day but it wasn't what they was used to at Darracott Place!</p> <p>Such visions as Charles had indulged when he had first blessed his good fortune at being hired to fill the post of second footman in a nobleman's establishment! A proper take-in that had been, and so he would tell his Dad! Dad, honourably retired from employment as butler to a Gentleman of Fashion, had assured him that to be hired to serve in a lord's country seat did not mean that he would be immured in rural fastness throughout the year. My lord (said Dad) would certainly retire to Kent during the winter months; but at the beginning of the Season he would remove to his London house; and at the end of the Season (said Dad) the chances were that he would hire a house in Brighton for the summer months. And from time to time, of course, he would be absent, visiting friends in other parts of the country, during which periods his servants would enjoy a great deal of leisure, and might even be granted leave to go on holiday.</p> <p>But nothing like that had happened at Darracott Place since Charles had first entered its portals. My lord, whose grim mouth and arctic stare could set stronger knees than Charles's knocking together, remained in residence all the year round, neither entertaining nor being entertained. And no use for anyone to tell Charles that this was because the Family was in mourning for Mr Granville Darracott and his son, Mr Oliver, both drowned off the coast of Cornwall in an ill-fated boating expedition: Charles might only have been second footman at Darracott Place for a couple of months when that disaster occurred, but no one could gammon him into thinking that my lord cared a spangle for his heir. If you were to ask him, Charles would say that my lord cared for no one but Mr Richmond: he certainly couldn't abide Mr Matthew Darracott, who was the last of his sons left alive; while as for Mr Claud, who was the younger of Mr Matthew's two sons, it was as much as anyone could do not to burst out laughing to see my lord look at him as if he was a cockroach, or a bed-bug. Nor, though he didn't look at him like that, could you think he cared a groat for Mr Vincent neither; while as for poor Mrs Darracott, as kind a lady as you'd find anywhere, even if she was a bit of a prattle-box, it seemed like she had only to open her mouth for my lord to give her one of his nasty set-downs. He didn't, it was true, do that to Miss Anthea, but that was probably because Miss Anthea wasn't scared of him, like her Ma, and would maybe give as good as she got; it wasn't because he was fond of her, as you'd think her granddad would be. It wouldn't be Miss Anthea as would coax him out of his sullens; it would be Mr Richmond.</p> <p>But Richmond, his grandfather's darling, after one thoughtful glance cast under his lashes at that uncompromising countenance appeared to lose himself in his own reflections. Some pickled crab, which he had not touched, had been removed with a damson pie; and his sister saw, peeping round the massive silver epergne that almost obscured him from her view, that he had eaten no more than a spoonful of this either. Since he had partaken quite liberally of two of the dishes that had made up the first course she was undismayed by anything other than her grandfather's failure to notice his present abstention. In general Lord Darracott would have bullied Richmond into eating the pie, imperfectly concealing his anxious affection for the youth, whose earlier years had been attended by every sort of ailment, under a hectoring manner, to which Richmond, docile yet unafraid, would submit.</p> <p>As little as Charles the footman did Anthea, or Mrs Darracott, or even Richmond understand the cause of his lordship's brooding ill-humour; rather less than Charles did any one of these three believe that it sprang from grief at the death of his eldest son. His lordship had both disliked and despised Granville; yet when the news of that fatal accident had reached Darracott Place he had been for many minutes like a man struck to stone; and when he had recovered from the first shock he had horrified his son Matthew, and Lissett, his man of business, by saying several times over, and in a voice of icy rage: &#x2018;Damn him! Damn him! Damn him!' They had almost feared for his reason, and had stood staring at him with dropped jaws until he had violently ordered them out of his sight. Matthew had never dared to enquire what extraordinary circumstances had provoked this outburst, and his lordship neither offered an explanation nor again referred to the matter. Only a black cloud seemed to descend on him, rendering him more unapproachable than ever, and so brittle-tempered that Mrs Darracott quite dreaded having to address him, and even Richmond several times had his head bitten off.</p> <p>Dinner was always a protracted meal; tonight it seemed interminable; but at last it came to an end. As the servants began to remove the covers, Mrs Darracott picked up her reticule, and rose.</p> <p>His lordship's hard, frowning eyes lifted; he said curtly: &#x2018;Wait!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Wait, sir?' faltered Mrs Darracott.</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, wait!' he repeated impatiently. &#x2018;Sit down! I have something to say to you!'</p> <p>She sank back on to her chair, looking at once bewildered and apprehensive. Anthea, who had risen with her, remained standing, her head turned towards her grandfather, her brows a little raised. He paid no heed to her; his eyes were on the two footmen, and it was not until they had left the room that he spoke again. So forbidding was his expression that Mrs Darracott, in growing trepidation, began to search wildly in her mind for some forgotten error of omission or commission. Chollacombe softly shut the door on the heels of his subordinates, and picked up the port decanter from the sideboard; he perceived that his master's hands were clenching and unclenching on the arms of his chair, and his heart sank: there had been a storm brewing all day, and it was going to burst now over their heads.</p> <p>But when my lord again spoke it was as though it cost him an effort. He said: &#x2018;You will be good enough, Elvira, to inform Flitwick that I expect my son and his family here tomorrow. Make what arrangements you choose!'</p> <p>She was so much surprised that she was betrayed into uttering an unwise exclamation. &#x2018;Good gracious! Is that all? But what in the world I mean, I hadn't the least notion '</p> <p>&#x2018;What brings them here, sir?' asked Anthea, intervening to draw her grandfather's fire.</p> <p>He looked for a moment as though he were about to utter one of his rough snubs, but after a slight pause he answered her. &#x2018;They are coming because I've sent for them, miss!' He paused again, and then said: &#x2018;You may as well know now as later! I've sent for my heir as well.'</p> <p>At these bitterly uttered words Chollacombe nearly dropped the decanter.</p> <p>&#x2018;Sent for your heir as well?' repeated Richmond. &#x2018;But my uncle Matthew is your heir, Grandfather isn't he?'</p> <p>&#x2018;No.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Then who is, sir?' demanded Anthea.</p> <p>&#x2018;A weaver's brat!' he replied, his voice vibrant with loathing.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, dear!' said Mrs Darracott, breaking the stunned silence that succeeded his lordship's announcement.</p> <p>The hopeless inadequacy of this exclamation dragged a choke of laughter out of Anthea, but it caused his lordship's smouldering fury to flare up. &#x2018;Is that all you have to say? Is that all, woman? You are a wet-goose a widgeon a take yourself off, and your daughter with you! Go and chatter, and marvel, and bless yourselves, but keep out of my sight and hearing! By God, I don't know how I bear with you!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, indeed!' said Anthea instantly. &#x2018;It is a great deal too bad, sir! Mama, how could you speak so to one so full of compliance and good nature as my grandfather? So truly the gentleman! Come away at once!'</p> <p>&#x2018;That's what you think of me, is it, girl?' said his lordship, a glint in his eyes.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, no!' she responded, dropping him a curtsy. &#x2018;It's what I say, sir! You must known that my featherheaded Mama has taught me to behave with all the propriety in the world! To tell you what I think of you would be to sink myself quite below reproach! Come, Mama!'</p> <p>He gave a bark of laughter. &#x2018;Tongue-valiant, eh?'</p> <p>She had reached the door, which Chollacombe was holding open, but she looked back at that. &#x2018;Try me!'</p> <p>&#x2018;I will!' he promised.</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, Anthea, pray !' whispered Mrs Darracott, almost dragging her from the room. She added, as Chollacombe closed the door behind them: &#x2018;My love, you should not! You know you should not! What, I ask you, would become of us if he were to cast us off?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, he won't do that!' replied Anthea confidently. &#x2018;Even he must feel that once in a lifetime is enough for the performance of that idiocy! I collect that the weaver's son is the offspring of the uncle we are never permitted to mention? Who is he, and what is he, and oh, come and tell me all about it, Mama! You know we have leave to marvel and chatter as much as we choose!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Yes, but I don't know anything,' objected Mrs Darracott, allowing herself to be drawn into one of the saloons that opened on to the central hall of the house. &#x2018;Indeed, I never knew of his existence until your grandfather threw him at my head in that scrambling way! And I consider,' she added indignantly, &#x2018;that I behaved with perfect propriety, for I took it with composure, and I'm sure it was enough to have cast me into strong hysterics! He would have been well-served if I had fallen senseless at his feet. I was never more shocked!'</p> <p>A smile danced in her daughter's eyes, but she said with becoming gravity: &#x2018;Exactly so! But a well-bred ease of manner, you know, is quite wasted on my grandfather. Mama, when you ruffle up your feathers you look like a very pretty partridge!'</p> <p>&#x2018;But I am not wearing feathers!' objected the widow. &#x2018;Feathers for a mere family evening, and in the country, too! It would be quite ineligible, my love! Besides, you should not say such things!'</p> <p>&#x2018;No, very true! It was the stupidest comparison, for whoever saw a partridge in purple plumage? You look like a turtle-dove, Mama!'</p> <p>Mrs Darracott allowed this to pass. Her mind, never tenacious, was diverted to the delicate sheen of her gown. She had fashioned it herself, from a roll of silk unearthed from the bottom of a trunk stored in one of the attics, and she was pardonably pleased with the result of her skill. The design had been copied from a plate in the previous month's issue of The Mirror of Fashion, but she had improved upon it, substituting some very fine Brussels lace (relic of her trousseau) for the chenille trimming of the illustration. Her father-in-law might apostrophize her as a wet-goose, but even he could scarcely have denied (had he had the least understanding of such matters) that she was a notable needlewoman. She was also a very pretty woman, with a plump, trim figure, large blue eyes, and a quantity of fair hair which was partially concealed under a succession of becoming caps. From the moment when she had detected a suspicion of sagging under her jaw she had made her caps to tie beneath her chin, or (more daringly) her ear; and the result was admirable. She was neither learned nor intelligent, but she contrived to dress both herself and her daughter out of a meagre jointure, supplying with her clever fingers what her purse could not buy; and she had never, during the twelve years of her widowhood, allowed either her father-in-law's snubs or the frequent discomforts of her situation to impair the amiability of her disposition. Her temper being cheerful, and the trend of her mind optimistic, she seldom fretted over the major trials which were beyond her power to mend. Her daughter, of whom she was extremely fond, was twenty-two years of age and still unwed; her spirited young son, whom she adored, was kept kicking his heels in idleness to serve his grandfather's caprice; but although she recognized that such a state of affairs was deplorable she could not help feeling that something would happen to make all right, and was able, without much difficulty, to put such dismal thoughts aside, and to expend her anxiety on lesser and more remediable problems.</p> <p>Anthea's quizzing remark brought one of these to her mind. Smoothing a crease from the purple-bloom satin, she said very seriously: &#x2018;You know, dearest, it will be excessively awkward!'</p> <p>&#x2018;What will be awkward? The weaver's son?'</p> <p>&#x2018;Oh, him ! No, poor boy though of course it will be! I was thinking of your Aunt Aurelia. I am persuaded she will expect to see us in mourning. You know what a high stickler she is for every observance! She will think it very odd of us to be wearing colours even improper!'</p> <p>&#x2018;Not at all!' replied Anthea coolly. &#x2018;By the time my grandfather has demanded to be told what cause she has to wear mourning for my uncle and my cousin, and has made her the recipient of his views on females rigging themselves out to look like so many crows, she will readily understand why you and I have abstained from that particular observance.'</p> <p>Mrs Darracott considered this rather dubiously. &#x2018;Well, yes, but there is no depending on your grandfather. I think we should at least wear black ribbons.'</p> <p>&#x2018;Very well, Mama, we will wear whatever you choose at least, I will do so if you will stop teasing yourself about such fripperies and tell me about the weaver's son, and the uncle who must not be mentioned.'</p> <p>&#x2018;But I don't know anything!' protested Mrs Darracott. &#x2018;Only that he was the next brother to poor Granville, and quite your grandfather's favourite son. Your papa was used to say that that was what enraged Grandpapa so particularly, though for my part I can't believe that he held him in the slightest affection! Never, never could I bring myself to disown my son! Not thou...</p></p><h2>Before I forget: Autobiography and drawings</h2><p>An outstanding star of the British and American screen for close to 40 years, James Mason looks back on a career with a wealth of stories.

Attaining feminine perfection meant conforming to a mythical standard, one that would come wrapped in an adorable pink package, if those cunning marketers were to be believed. With wise humor and a savvy eye for curious, absurd, and at times wildly funny period artifacts, Lynn Peril gathers here the memorabilia of the era &#x2015;from kitschy board games and lunch boxes to outdated advice books and health pamphlets&#x2015;and reminds us how media messages have long endeavored to shape women's behavior and self-image, with varying degrees of success. Vividly illustrated with photographs of vintage paraphernalia, this entertaining social history revisits the nostalgic past, but only to offer a refreshing message to women who lived through those years as well as those who are coming of age now. 8 pages of color, 45 black-and-white illustrations.</p><p>Lynn Peril is the author of Pink Think, College Girls, and Swimming in the Steno Pool. Her column, The Museum of Femoribilia, appears in BUST magazine. She lives in Oakland, California.Books titled How to Fascinate Men and How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead. Hope chests. Home economics courses at the college level. Ah, womanhood. Peril, founder of the zine Mystery Date, devoted to her obsession with old etiquette and self-help books, analyzes these and other marvels in her first book. "Pink think" is "a set of ideas and attitudes about what constitutes proper female behavior," she says, and it "assumes there is a standard of behavior to which all women... must aspire." In casual, friendly language, Peril who shares tales of her own childhood pink think rebellion charts the amusing yet sad history of how women have been conditioned with a set of rules that often begins with someone telling them little girls are made of "sugar and spice and everything nice." A pop culture history of achieving the feminine ideal, the book explores everything from childhood and adolescence to marriage and the workplace. Spurred on by the "Patron Saint of Pink Think," Jayne Mansfield, pink think infiltrated frighteningly numerous aspects of women's lives from the 1940s through the '70s and was often driven by advertisements pitching girls' versions of house-cleaning supplies and feminine hygiene products that counseled women to douche regularly in order to ensure a happy marriage. In an afterword, Peril expresses her dismay at the apparent preservation of pink think today (witness the success of 1995's The Rules and 2001's The Surrendered Wife). Although her book may leave some women thinking, "OK, we've ditched the maternity girdles so now what?" it's hilariously entertaining.

Lord Peter Wimsey could imagine the artist stepping back, the stagger, the fall, down to where the pointed rocks grinned like teeth. But was it an accident - or murder? Six members of the close-knit Galloway artists&#39; colony do not regret Campbell&#39;s death. Five of them are red herrings.</p><p><p><em>Lord Peter Wimsey must ferret out a murderer in a Scottish art colony in this classic tale from Dorothy L. Sayers.</em></p><p>In the scenic Scottish village of Kirkcudbright, no one is disliked more than the painter Sandy Campbell. When he is found dead at the foot of a cliff, his easel standing above, no one is sorry to see him gone&#x2014;especially six members of the close-knit Galloway artists' colony.</p><p>The inimitable Lord Peter Wimsey is on the scene to determine the truth about Campbell's death. Piecing together the evidence, the aristocratic sleuth discovers that of the six suspected painters, five are red herrings, innocent of the crime. But just which one is the ingenious artist with a talent for murder?</p>Dorothy L Sayers was born in Oxford in 1893, and was both a classical scholar and a graduate in modern languages. As well as her popular Lord Peter Wimsey series, she wrote several religious plays, but considered her translations of Dante&#39;s Divina Commedia to be her best work.

The positive outlook of Buddhism and the meditative principle of living in the moment came to influence his study and practice of psychotherapy profoundly. <i>Going on Being </i>is Epstein&#x2019;s memoir of his early years as a student of Buddhism and of how Buddhism shaped his approach to therapy, as well as a practical guide to how a Buddhist understanding of psychological problems makes change for the better possible. <br><br><i>Going on Being </i>is an intimate chronicle of the evolution of spirit and psyche, and a highly inviting guide for anyone seeking a new path and a new outlook on life.</p><p>Can you remember the childhood feeling of living happily moment to moment, without intrusive aims or fears? Psychoanalyst D.W. Winnicott called it the state of "going on being." Bestselling author Mark Epstein sees a similarity with the Buddhist practice of mindfulness, of just watching the mind and body without holding on or pushing away. Epstein excels at finding the similarities between Buddhist meditation and psychotherapy, and he is in top form in <i>Going On Being</i>. Offering an autobiographical account of his own gradual discovery of this nexus, Epstein tells of his encounters with such luminaries as Ram Dass, Joseph Goldstein, and Jack Kornfield, ruminating on them and then showing how his insights shed light on his work as a psychoanalyst. Ultimately, he finds that psychoanalysis can function as a kind of interpersonal meditation, helping the patient see aspects of the self that are hidden behind habitual ways of reacting to the world. <i>Going On Being</i> shows that, if done well, psychotherapy can offer some of the same benefits as Buddhist meditation. Eureka! <i>--Brian Bruya</i>"A thoughtful and compassionate view of what therapy can accomplish when it recognizes the indivisibility of the psyche and spirit."<br>&#x2013;<i>New Age</i><br><br>"Lucid and thoughtful."&#x2013;<i>Elle<br><br></i>"Like the best Buddhist masters, Epstein tells wonderful stories, full of wisdom and flashes of inspiration.

They arrived in Virginia in the spring of 1607 and set about trying to create a settlement on a tiny island in the James River. Despite their shortcomings, and against the odds, they built Jamestown, a ramshackle outpost that laid the foundations of the British Empire and the United States of America.</p><p>Drawing on new discoveries, neglected sources and manuscript collections scattered across the world, <em>Savage Kingdom</em> challenges the textbook image of Jamestown as a mere money-making venture. It reveals a reckless, daring enterprise led by outcasts of the Old World who found themselves interlopers in a new one. It charts their journey into a beautiful landscape and a sophisticated culture that they found both ravishing and alien, which they yearned to possess but threatened to destroy. They called their new home a "savage kingdom," but it was the savagery they had experienced in Europe that had driven them across the ocean and which they hoped to escape by building in America "one of the most glorious nations under the sun."</p><p>An intimate story in an epic setting, Woolley shows how the land of Pocahontas came to be drawn into a new global order, reaching from London to the Orinoco Delta, from the warring kingdoms of Angola to the slave markets of Mexico, from the gates of the Ottoman Empire to the foothills of the Blue Ridge Mountains.</p></p><p><p>Benjamin Woolley is an award-winning writer and broadcaster.

He has won the Arts Journalist of the Year Award and an Emmy for his commentary for Discovery's <em>Three Minutes to Impact</em>. He lives in London.</p>The Jamestown settlement of 1607, like so many other events surrounding the birth of America, is shrouded in myth. Woolleys history of early Virginia--released to celebrate the colonys 400th anniversary--seeks to set the historical record straight with respect to John Smith, Pocahontas, and the lesser known settlers. David Drummonds narration is straightforward and easy to listen to, and he does his best to liven up the material. He clearly adjusts his delivery to indicate when hes reading a historical quote rather than Woolleys own words. Ultimately, however, the text is simply not engaging, and the production sounds like a long lecture rather than a narrative of an exciting and adventurous period in American history.

He glanced at the clock radio.<br><br>Four-thirty.<br><br>"Hell," he said, tempted to crawl back under the down comforter.<br><br>Instead he stood up on a thick, brightly colored carpet&#x2014;yellow sunflowers against a blue background&#x2014;on the pine-board floor and walked over to the double windows, their cream-colored drapes pulled tightly shut against the Vermont cold.<br><br>He'd arrived after dark last night. It'd still be dark out now.<br><br>He opened the drapes, anyway.<br><br>Yep. Dark.<br><br>He felt the below-freezing outside air seep through the windows but left the drapes open. In Southern California, he'd be asleep. Even in northern New England, with the three-hour time difference, he should be asleep. After his long flight yesterday and his drive from a small airport an hour north of the lodge, he'd almost turned around and found somewhere else to spend the night.<br><br>He'd always expected he'd check out Black Falls, Vermont, at some point, but it wasn't his ten-year friendship with Sean Cameron, his business partner and fellow smoke jumper in California, that had finally brought him East to the Green Mountains and Cameron country.<br><br>It was a serial arsonist. A killer.<br><br>And it was Sean's sister, Rose.<br><br>Nick looked over at the bed with its posts and pictured Rose in his bed in Beverly Hills eight months ago, her skin glowing in the aftermath of their lovemaking. She'd caught him staring at her and had pulled the sheet over her nakedness, as if only realizing just then what a huge mistake she'd made.<br><br>He raked a hand through his hair and bolted for the bathroom, with its gleaming porcelain and chrome and its soft, ultrawhite towels. He turned on the shower and tore open a bar of Vermont-made goat's milk soap while he waited for the water to heat up. He climbed in, stood under the stream of water as hot as he could stand and told himself he still could turn back.<br><br>He didn't have to see anyone else in Black Falls.<br><br>He didn't have to see Rose.<br><br>For ten years he'd fought wildfires, and for six years he'd served on a navy submarine. He'd faced dangers and hardships, and he'd seen people die&#x2014;he'd come close to death himself. He'd always done his best and acted honorably, even when he'd screwed up.<br><br>Until Rose Cameron.<br><br>As he shut off the shower and reached for a towel, he could taste her mouth, feel her breasts under his palms, hear her soft cries as she'd climaxed under him, clawing at him, sobbing his name.<br><br>They'd known exactly what they were doing that night.<br><br><em>Exactly.</em><br><br>Nick toweled off and got dressed in the warmest clothes he'd packed. He doubted he'd pass for a Vermont mountain man, but he didn't care. He headed out to the hall, shutting his door quietly behind him and taking the stairs down to the lobby. The lodge, long owned and operated by the Cameron family, hadn't seemed crowded when he'd arrived at nine o'clock last night. From what he'd learned from Sean over the years, it drew its biggest crowds in the warm-weather months.<br><br>Just as well, considering the spate of violence the town had experienced since the fall.<br><br>Since last spring, really.<br><br>A brochure tacked open on a bulletin board in the lobby listed daily winter activities. Nick could take his pick of such diversions as snowshoeing, cross-country skiing, arts and crafts, yoga, nature walks and dance lessons. He wouldn't lack for things to do, except he wasn't at the lodge for fun.<br><br>A fire was already crackling in the stone fireplace just down from the front desk, where A. J. Cameron, the flinty eldest of the four Cameron siblings, stood, still in his canvas jacket. His blue eyes and the hard set of his jaw reminded Nick of Rose. She'd said Sean was the charmer of the family.<br><br>It definitely wasn't A.J.<br><br>Or her, for that matter.<br><br>"Coffee's available," A.J. said. "Breakfast doesn't start until six."<br><br>"That's fine. I thought I'd head over to the Whit-taker estate. Sean mentioned Rose has been training her search-and-rescue dog out there one or two mornings a week." Nick tried to sound matter-of-fact instead of like a man who'd impulsively slept with the Cameron brothers' baby sister at a vulnerable moment in her life. "He says she's an early bird."<br><br>A.J. unzipped his jacket. Unlike his two younger brothers, he'd lived in Vermont his entire life. So had Rose, but as a search management consultant and member of an expert disaster search-and-rescue team, she traveled frequently.<br><br>Her eldest brother frowned. "I suppose you want to see for yourself where Sean nearly got himself killed last month."<br><br>"Yes," Nick said carefully, settling on an incomplete answer. "I'm up. Might as well get moving."<br><br>A.J. didn't relax, but he didn't look suspicious, either. "I take it you know Rose from her trips out to California."<br><br>"We've run into each other a few times when she's stopped in to see Sean."<br><br>That was Nick's rehearsed answer, and he thought he delivered it reasonably well.<br><br>The Cameron blue eyes narrowed. Nick understood A.J.'s scrutiny. For eighteen months, quiet, cerebral Lowell Whittaker had run a network of paid killers, putting people who wanted someone killed together with people willing to do the killing. During that time, he and his wife, Vivian, had bought a country home in Black Falls.<br><br>Now they both were under arrest&#x2014;Lowell on serious, multiple charges for his role as a murderous mastermind; Vivian, for attempted murder. She was cooperating with authorities to get the charges reduced. Her husband wasn't cooperating with anyone, including, apparently, his own lawyers, who were urging him to turn over any information he had on his killers, his clients and their victims and potential victims.<br><br>Among Lowell Whittaker's past victims was Drew Cameron, the seventy-seven-year-old father of A.J., Elijah, Sean and Rose Cameron, killed last April after he'd come too close to figuring out the Black Falls newcomer wasn't the gentleman farmer he pretended to be.<br><br>At first, Drew Cameron's death in an early-spring snowstorm had appeared to be accidental. By November, everyone knew better. He'd been murdered&#x2014;deliberately left to die of exposure&#x2014;by two of Lowell Whittaker's assassins, both now dead themselves.<br><br>In between April and November, Rose Cameron had turned up in Los Angeles to lead a training session.<br><br>And now here I am<em>, </em>Nick thought.<br><br>A.J. tilted his head back. "You want to tell me what you're doing in Vermont?"<br><br>"Curiosity," Nick said with a smile.<br><br>A.J. didn't press him further and gave Nick direct ions. And why not? Why shouldn't any of the Camerons trust him with their sister?<br><br>No reason. None at all.<br><br>"I have no regrets about last night," Rose had told him that morning in June. "I just want to go home to Vermont and pretend it never happened. I won't say anything to anyone. I hope you won't, either."<br><br>Nick had promised her he'd keep his mouth shut.<br><br>He thanked A.J. for the directions and went out into the frigid mountain air. His jacket, boots and gloves weren't rated for temperatures in the low teens, but they'd have to do. The sky was lightening, Cameron Mountain looming across the quiet road that ran along a ridge above the village of Black Falls. The Camerons' mountain resort consisted of the main lodge, cottages, a shop, a recreational building and several hundred acres of picturesque meadows and woods that hooked up with public land, offering guests an extensive network of trails for hiking, mountain biking and backcountry skiing.<br><br>Another time, Nick thought.<br><br>His rented car started on the first try. Given the winter conditions and mountain roads, he'd gone with all-wheel drive. He followed the ridge past a line of bare maple trees to an intersection that A.J. had described as Harper Four Corners. A former early nineteenth-century tavern Sean owned was on one corner. Across from it was an old cemetery, its rectangular slabs of granite tombstones etched against the predawn sky. A white-steepled church occupied the corner across from the cemetery. On the fourth corner was a crumbling barn.<br><br>Sean had tried to explain his hometown of Black Falls, but Nick could see for himself as he turned up past the tavern and old barn, onto Cameron Mountain Road. He knew Rose's house was up here somewhere.<br><br>She lived a totally different life from his in Southern California.<br><br>Eventually the road wound its way to a shallow, rock-strewn river, frozen and snow-covered in the Vermont winter cold. He came to a sprawling, boarded-up farmhouse on an open hilltop above the river. It had partially burned in January when Lowell Whittaker had set off a bomb, hoping to kill his wife and a local stonemason he was trying to frame. His wife had figured out what was going on, saved herself and left Bowie O'Rourke, the stonemason, to die in the fire. Sean had saved O'Rourke. Vivian Whittaker now insisted she'd been in shock. The truth was, she'd wanted her husband to get away with murder.<br><br>Just not <em>her </em>murder.<br><br>Nick had seen pictures of the Whittakers. They looked like an ordinary, upper-class couple.<br><br>He pulled into an icy but plowed turnaround and parked next to a black Volvo sedan. It wasn't Rose's. He didn't know as much about her as he should, given their brief, intense love affair&#x2014;never mind that she was Sean's sister&#x2014;but he did know she drove a Jeep.<br><br>So who owned the Volvo?<br><br>He grimaced as he got out of his car. What if she were meeting some guy here and just didn't want her brothers to know? The prying eyes of a small town and all that. He hadn't seen or even been in touch with Rose in eight months. He couldn't expect her to keep her life on hold, especially since she was pretending their night together had never happened.<br><br>He wasn't. He hadn't spoken of it and wouldn't, but he wasn't about to pretend it had never happened. He wanted to remember every second of making love to her, even if it had been a mistake.<br><br>A big one.<br><br>Nick hunched his shoulders against a cold breeze and headed onto a shoveled walk that led to a small stone house that he knew, from Sean's descriptions, was the Whittakers' guesthouse. He noticed footprints in the blanket of white on the slope up to the main farmhouse. He didn't much feel like a trek through knee-deep snow. All he needed was to trip and end up having Rose Cameron and her search-and-rescue dog come find him.<br><br>He stepped into one of the prints, a clump of wet snow falling into his boot. Served him right, he thought, and followed the prints, which looked relatively fresh, to the edge of the woods above the river. He figured he could always forget this whole thing, backtrack to his car and go have pancakes at the lodge, but he continued up toward the farmhouse.<br><br>The breeze stirred again as he crested the hill.<br><br>He smelled smoke in the air and went still.<br><br>The smell was distinct, unmistakable and recent. Nick was positive it wasn't the residue of the January fire that had almost killed two people and burned down the place.<br><br>He dipped past a white pine and squinted up at the gray clapboard farmhouse. The sunrise glowed on the horizon, its deep pink color spreading across the sky.<br><br>Something was wrong. Badly wrong.<br><br><em>Rose</em>.<br><br>Nick moved faster through the snow.<br><br>Rose Cameron paused on the shoveled walk up to the farmhouse that had been built in the 1920s by a New Yorker with a romantic view of Vermont. Too expensive for Black Falls residents, it had always been owned by out-of-staters, but none, she thought, quite like the despicable Lowell and Vivian Whittaker.<br><br>But Rose didn't want to think about them and shifted her attention to Ranger, her eight-year-old golden retriever, as he ran into the snow along the edge of the walk. He looked good, she thought. Healthy and agile, not as stiff as earlier in the winter. Taking the time to concentrate on training was paying off. She'd parked her Jeep in the main driveway, and he'd jumped out, as eager as a puppy.<br><br>She smiled as she watched the vibrant fuchsia and purples of dawn melt into the early-morning sky. The cold weather didn't faze her.<br><br></p><h2>French Quarter Manual: An Architectural Guide to New Orleans&#x2019;s Vieux Carr�</h2><p><p>In New Orleans, the French Quarter packs itself into a little grid of a colonial town behind the levee of the Mississippi River. Established in 1718, the town received its gridded plan from a French military engineer in 1721. Most of the buildings standing today date from the nineteenth century, with eighteenth and twentieth century structures interspersed.</p><p>This detailed architectural handbook describes how to "read" French Quarter architecture by determining a structure's "type," its component parts, and its style. The basic "types" are termed the French Colonial house, the Spanish Colonial house, the cottage, the town house, and the shotgun house. The basic "component parts" are doors, windows, shutters, balconies, courtyards. The styles are based upon decorative motifs common to distinctive historical periods (Federal, Greek Revival, Gothic, Italianate, etc.). Each reveals that the colonists' native architectural traditions were transformed into a set of structures adapted to the moist heat of semitropical Louisiana. With images of buildings, plans, and sections from the French Quarter's remarkable inventory, this guide illustrates how a succession of styles from the eighteenth to the twentieth century has been draped over a range of building types.</p><p> Thoroughly indexed and cross-referenced, it will provide with equal satisfaction a start-to-finish "read," a search for specific information, or a concentrated browse. Illustrated with some 200 photographs and 50 line drawings, this handy manual will be essential for architects, historic preservationists, and general readers interested in the buildings of one of America's richest historic districts.</p></p><p><p>A handbook for discovering the architectural gems in the Vieux Carr� of New Orleans</p><b>Malcolm Heard</b> was an architect and a teacher in the School of Architecture at Tulane University.</p><h2>The Strong and the Weak</h2><p>Case histories illustrate an examination of the process of overcoming personal anxieties and fears through greater self-understanding and acceptance of psychic and spiritual strengths</p><p>Paul Tournier (1898-1986) was a general practitioner in Geneva and also an active Christian.

In the decades that followed the American Civil War, Artist James E. Kelly (1855-1933) conducted in-depth interviews with over forty Union Generals in an effort to accurately portray them in their greatest moment of glory. Kelly explained: &#34;I had always felt a great lact of certain personal details. I made up my mind to ask from living officers every question I would have asked Washington or his generals had they posed for me, such as: What they considered the principal incidents in their career and particulars about costumes and surroundings.&#34; During one interview session with Gen. Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, Kelly asked about the charge at Fort Damnation. Gen. Chamberlain acquiesced, but then added, &#34;I don&#39;t see how you can show this in a picture.&#34; &#34;Just tell me the facts,&#34; Kelly responded, &#34;and I&#39;ll attend to the picture.&#34; And by recording those stirring facts, Kelly left us not only his wonderful art, but a truly unique picture of the lives of the great figures of the American Civil War.</p><p>William B. Styple has edited, co-authored, and authored several works on the Civil War. His book: &#34;The Little Bugler&#34; won the Young Readers&#39; Award from the Civil War Round Table of New York. He is currently writing the biography of Gen. Phil Kearny.Civil War artist James Kelly sketched and interviewed 40 Union Army generals in the years following the war. While making his drawings, Kelly probed the soldiers with intimate questions about their military dress, the high points of their lives, and the minute details of their notable battles. Narrator Patrick Cullen uses the generals' conversations with the artist to sculpt personalities for each, making the famous men lifelike, distinctive, and memorable. His General Sherman is a cranky, abrupt, and rude character while a few words from General Lee at the signing of the surrender at Appomattox reveal a tired-sounding officer with a soft Southern drawl. While some narrators might overdo such a performance, Cullen summons prudent restraint to avoid comedy in his pursuit of realism.

This new release makes most of that historic collection available to everyone in splendid full-color photographs and features over 200 patterns and assembly diagrams to help you reproduce the blocks in your own quilts.</p><p>Carrie Alma Hackett Hall is best known for her partnership in the book &#34;The Romance of the Patchwork Quilt in America&#34; with Rose Kretsinger. She was responsible for preserving nearly every known patchwork pattern from their era! Author Bettina Havig takes the historical approach to the collection one step further and features piecing diagrams for sewing and pattern templates for creating 200 of these blocks.Carrie Hall, an early 20th-century Kansas quiltmaker, had an ambitious plan. She set out to preserve America's quiltmaking heritage by collecting every known patchwork pattern and piecing one cloth block for every pattern. She spent years collecting patterns and piecing the blocks. In 1935 her collection, photographed in black and white, appeared in The Romance of the Patchwork Quilt in America. Made between 1900 and 1935 and now housed in the Spencer Museum at the University of Kansas, these blocks are a rich source of information for quilters, quilt historians, and quilt collectors. In compiling Carrie Hall's Blocks, Havig has made Hall's collection even more accessible to the modern quilter. The first section is a gallery of Hall's blocks, including color photographs, the name of the pattern, museum accession number, and measurements of the original block. For the second section, Havig has chosen 200 additional blocks for fuller treatment. For each of these blocks there is a color photo, a piecing diagram, and full-size templates so that today's quilter can enjoy making many of Hall's historic blocks. This important reference source for the quilt historian and collector is recommended for both academic and public libraries. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Full of Life: A Biography of John Fante</h2><p>The first biography of one of the great outsiders of American literature.<br><br>In the first comprehensive biography of John Fante, one of the great lost souls of twentieth-century literature, Stephen Cooper untangles the enigma of an authentic American original. By turns savage and poetic, violent and full of love, such underground novels as The Road to Los Angeles; Ask the Dust; and Wait Until Spring, Bandini simultaneously reveal and disguise their author.<br><br>Born in 1909 to poor Italian American parents in Colorado, Fante ventured west in 1930 to become a writer. Eventually settling in Los Angeles' faded downtown area of Bunker Hill, Fante starved between menial Depression-era jobs while writing story after story about the world he knew-full of poverty, hatred, and the madness of love. His first stories were published by H. L. Mencken in the American Mercury, but Fante also made a career in Hollywood working with the likes of Orson Welles and Darryl F. Zanuck.<br><br>By the time of his death, though, he was nearly forgotten. Fortunately, readers such as Charles Bukowski began to recognize that Ask the Dust stands alongside the best work of Nathanael West and Sherwood Anderson. This exacting and vivid biography will help secure Fante's place in the American literary pantheon.<br></p><p>Unfamiliar with the works of John Fante? Sadly, you're not alone. While his few novels received critical acclaim, they went out of print quickly, and for most of his career Fante relied on Hollywood screenwriting to support both his family and his habits. Stephen Cooper has done a terrific job of uncovering Fante's life here, and more than anything, his biography makes the reader want to turn back to the writer's books (<i>Ask the Dust</i>, <i>Wait Until Spring, Bandini</i>, <i>The Road to Los Angeles</i>, <i>The Brotherhood of the Grape</i>, among others--all currently in print, courtesy of Black Sparrow Press). With elegant prose and painstaking detail, Cooper reveals a tortured man who once ended a letter with this telling statement: "Writing is a great joy, but the profession of writing is horrible." Beginning with Fante's family history--immigration, menial labor, heavy drinking, and financial instability--and ending with a final 17-month hospitalization, the roller coaster that was his life is both fascinating and exhausting. Even while his screenplay <i>Full of Life</i> achieved critical accolades, Fante referred to himself as "that Hollywood whore, that stinking sell-out artist," and with every increase in his paycheck he seemed to fall further into bitterness. Throughout the pages that link Fante's professional and personal lives, we're shown a proud grandpa, an unrepentant gambler and heavy-drinking diabetic, and above all, a tremendously talented writer who was always his own worst critic. Would he appreciate being rescued from obscurity? Hard to say: as he wrote to his son in the early '60s, "Success is too vague a challenge. Maybe failure is even better; certainly it is more beautiful." <i>--Jill Lightner</i>S<b>tephen Cooper</b> is the winner of a 1991 National Endowment for the Arts grant for his fiction, and editor of John Fante's last book, <i>The Big Hunger: Stories 1932-1959</i>.

Jeremy Safran has assembled an absolutely stellar group of writers and has himself contributed an illuminating introduction. The essays are riveting and the book is the rare edited collection with real thematic unity. If you think you might have an interest in the intersection of psychoanalysis and Buddhism, this is the place to start. If you already know you're interested, once you look at the table of contents you'll find (at least I did) that you want to let Psychoanalysis and Buddhism displace whatever you were going to read next."--Donnel B. Stern, PhD, author of <i>Unformulated Experience</i> and editor of <i>Contemporary Psychoanalysis</i></p><p>Jeremy D. Safran, PhD, is a professor of clinical psychology at the New School for Social Research in New York. He received his doctorate in psychology from the University of British Columbia in 1982 and his postdoctoral certification in psychoanalysis from New York University in 2001. To learn more about his psychotherapy research lab, visit www.safranlab.netPreface <p>The roots of my involvement with Buddhism go back a long way, certainly as far back as my interests in Western psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. I first began meditating at a Zen center in Vancouver prior to beginning graduate training in clinical psychology in the early 1970's and long before undergoing psychoanalytic training. The teacher was an earnest young Zen monk from England. He had a pious manner more reminiscent of my stereotype of a Presbyterian minister than the iconoclastic Zen masters I had read about in Alan Watts' "Psychotherapy East and West." And he had little of the humor and spontaneity I would later come to experience in the Zen masters and Tibetan lamas who have had the greatest impact on me. But to his credit, he did manage to impress upon me the importance of actually sitting and meditating in a disciplined fashion. Although I can't claim to have always been the most diligent of practitioners, my interest in Buddhism has remained consistent over the years. Nevertheless, although the influence of Buddhist thought and practice on my professional writing began to explicitly appear as early as 1990, it has taken considerably longer for me to undertake a project such as this one. As to what all the forces are that finally motivated me to attempt to bring my interests in Buddhism and psychoanalysis together as the central focus of a professional project, I can only speculate. No doubt, as Freud taught us, there are multiple determinants, both conscious and unconscious. And perhaps as Buddhism teaches us there are karmic determinants as well. What I do know is that the time now feels ripe to me. </p><p>Although the dialogue between psychoanalysis and Buddhism has a long history, attempts to think about the interface of these two disciplines in a systematic fashion have been scattered and episodic in nature. Psychoanalysts who have been interested in this dialogue have tended to be on the margins- functioning outside of the mainstream of analytic thinking. In recent years, however, there has been an accelerating interest in Buddhism by psychoanalysts that parallels the growing interest in Buddhism both by Western psychotherapists in general and by the culture at large. This book is the first to initiate a formal dialogue between mainstream psychoanalysts and those who write about the interface of psychoanalysis and Buddhism. </p><p>It is structured in the form of: primary chapters followed by commentaries, followed by replies written by the authors of the primary chapters in response to the commentaries. The primary chapters explore various aspects of the interface between psychoanalysis and Buddhism. These chapters are written by authors who are equally conversant with the worlds of psychoanalysis and Buddhism, and who in many cases have made seminal contributions to this interface in the past. The commentaries are all written by psychoanalytic theorists who in most cases have a rather limited familiarity with the topic of Buddhism, but sufficient interest to be willing to engage in the dialogue. I was fortunate to be able to enlist the participation of a highly prominent group of psychoanalytic thinkers, many of whom have had an important impact on the development of contemporary psychoanalytic theory. Their willingness to participate in this enterprise is a reflection of the growing interest by psychoanalysts in Buddhism in recent years. Although there has always been an underground of "Buddhaphiles" within the psychoanalytic community, it is unlikely that the type of dialogue represented by this book could have taken place as recently as a few years ago. My hope is that this dialogue will help to raise thinking about the interface between psychoanalysis and Buddhism to a new level of sophistication, and to stimulate an interest in the topic by both a wider audience of psychoanalysts and psychotherapists, as well as the general public. </p><p>I have written the introductory chapter, "Psychoanalysis and Buddhism as Cultural Institutions", to provide a context for this dialogue. It does so by sketching out the cultural and historical factors that have influenced the development of both psychoanalysis and Buddhism, and that are currently influencing the accelerating interest in Buddhism within Western culture and by the psychoanalytic community. A second agenda of mine in this chapter is to review some of the major themes and developments within both psychoanalysis and Buddhism in order to provide some background for those who are less familiar with either of these two traditions. </p><p>A final objective of the my introductory chapter, and of the book as a whole, is to provide those who are not familiar with contemporary psychoanalysis with a taste of some of the exciting and forward looking developments that are taking place within it. Western psychotherapy began with the emergence of psychoanalysis at the beginning of the twentieth century and for many years psychoanalysis was the dominant form of psychological treatment. Although psychoanalysis has always provided a conceptually rich and sophisticated framework for understanding human experience, it has also had tendencies towards reductionistic thinking and pseudoscientific sterility. As it became increasingly well established as a cultural institution, it tended to lose some of its more revolutionary and progressive potential, and to become arrogant, conservative and insular. In the 1960's psychoanalysis began to fall upon hard times. Within the field of psychiatry it was superceded by the biological revolution. And as a form of psychotherapy, it was outflanked on one side by the cognitive-behavioral tradition, with its pragmatic emphasis and its claim to scientific legitimacy, and on the other by humanistic psychotherapists with their recognition of the fundamental importance of human dignity and potential. In recent years, however, there has been a revitalization in psychoanalytic theory and practice that has broken the shackles of conservatism and that is shaping it in a direction that is increasingly responsive to the yearnings of the human heart and soul. I see this book as both a reflection of this revitalization process and as a continuation of it. </p><p>Jeremy D.

It shows you how to find the truth behind deceptive food packaging. You will learn how to confidently read labels so that you will know how healthy a food really is and if it contains dangerous ingredients. </p> <p>This book classifies over 1000 commonly used food additives according to safety, whether they may cause allergic reactions, and if they are Generally Recognized As Safe (GRAS) by the FDA. In just seconds, the average person can determine if the food they're buying contains dangerous substances. The book is clear, concise and easy to use.</p></p><p>If you buy packaged foods, you need to read labels more today than ever before! Because of increasing consumer awareness about eating more healthfully, manufacturers are designing food packages to make it look like the food inside the package is healthy. But if you read and interpret the ingredients on the label, there's a very good chance that you'll find that is not the case. Many of the ingredients added to food are harmful. And it's even legal for food manufacturers to add cancer-causing substances to the food they produce. <p>Almost all packaged foods, even so called "health foods," have additives in them, and many are harmful or inadequately tested. For example: Aspartame, also known as NutraSweet and Equal, breaks down into substances called excititoxins which excite nerve cells in the brain to death. Ninety-two different symptoms from aspartame were reported to the FDA, including headaches, dizziness, seizures, speech and visual impairment, blindness and even death. It can cause symptoms which mimic the symptoms of numerous diseases, including Alzheimer's, epilepsy, chronic fatigue syndrome, depression, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Gulf War Syndrome and mental illness. Even people who don't experience symptoms can suffer long term damage. Carrageenan, a seaweed derivative often found in "health food" products, is a suspected carcinogen; it may contain hidden MSG. BHT, legal in the U.S. but banned in England, is associated with liver and kidney damage, behavioral problems, infertility, weakened immune system, birth defects and cancer. Brominated vegetable oil (BVO), an ingredient in a popular sports drink, and pediatric electrolyte replacement beverage is considered unsafe by the FDA, but can still lawfully be used until the FDA takes further action. It is linked to major organ system damage, birth defects and growth problems. Hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, found in most packaged products, are associated with heart disease, breast and colon cancer, atherosclerosis and elevated cholesterol. MSG is an excitotoxin which can excite nerve cells in the brain to death. Even people who don't experience reactions from consuming MSG can suffer long term damage. MSG can be hidden in many different ingredients, including broth, hydrolyzed protein, barley malt and whey protein. Nitrates and nitrites, powerful cancer-causing agents, are considered dangerous by the FDA, but are not banned because they prevent botulism. These are only a few examples of the many harmful substances legally added to our food. </p><p>So, be sure that what you're eating is healthy. With this book, you will discover how quick and easy it is to tell if the food you're buying contains dangerous ingredients. It contains all the information about food additives contained in the previous editions and more, updated information on the safety of the additives, more information on MSG, hidden MSG and free glutamates and new additives, like Olestra, Salatrim, Sucralose and Splenda. It even contains information on the additives, Alitame and Neotame, that are awaiting approval as of this writing. </p><p>You can't depend on the FDA or the food manufacturers to make sure the food you buy in the grocery store is safe.

He was not yet a focus of debate; his &#x201c;big book on species&#x201d; still lay on his study desk in the form of a huge pile of manuscript. For more than twenty years he had been accumulating material for it, puzzling over questions it raised, trying&#x2014;it seemed endlessly&#x2014;to bring it to a satisfactory conclusion. Publication appeared to be as far away as ever, delayed by his inherent cautiousness and wish to be certain that his startling theory of evolution was correct.<br><br>It is at this point that the concluding volume of Janet Browne&#x2019;s biography opens. The much-praised first volume, Voyaging, carried Darwin&#x2019;s story through his youth and scientific apprenticeship, the adventurous Beagle voyage, his marriage and the birth of his children, the genesis and development of his ideas. Now, beginning with the extraordinary events that finally forced the <i>Origin of Species</i> into print, we come to the years of fame and controversy.<br><br>For Charles Darwin, the intellectual upheaval touched off by his book had deep personal as well as public consequences. Always an intensely private man, he suddenly found himself and his ideas being discussed&#x2014;and often attacked&#x2014;in circles far beyond those of his familiar scientific community. Demonized by some, defended by others (including such brilliant supporters as Thomas Henry Huxley and Joseph Hooker), he soon emerged as one of the leading thinkers of the Victorian era, a man whose theories played a major role in shaping the modern world. Yet, in spite of the enormous new pressures, he clung firmly, sometimes painfully, to the quiet things that had always meant the most to him&#x2014;his family, his research, his network of correspondents, his peaceful life at Down House. <br><br>In her account of this second half of Darwin&#x2019;s life, Janet Browne does dramatic justice to all aspects of the Darwinian revolution, from a fascinating examination of the Victorian publishing scene to a survey of the often furious debates between scientists and churchmen over evolutionary theory. At the same time, she presents a wonderfully sympathetic and authoritative picture of Darwin himself right through the heart of the Darwinian revolution, busily sending and receiving letters, pursuing research on subjects that fascinated him (climbing plants, earthworms, pigeons&#x2014;and, of course, the nature of evolution), writing books, and contending with his mysterious, intractable ill health. Thanks to Browne&#x2019;s unparalleled command of the scientific and scholarly sources, we ultimately see Darwin more clearly than we ever have before, a man confirmed in greatness but endearingly human.<br><br>Reviewing Voyaging, Geoffrey Moorhouse observed that &#x201c;if Browne&#x2019;s second volume is as comprehensively lucid as her first, there will be no need for anyone to write another word on Darwin.&#x201d; The Power of Place triumphantly justifies that praise.</p><p><p>"I realized that I had never fully understood Fitzroy or Lyell or Dr. Darwin or Emma ... especially Darwin himself. Janet Browne not only makes these historical figures real, three dimensional people, but she shows so elegantly how they affected and interacted with one another. This is not just another biography of Darwin, but a unique and important contribution; it will outlast all others. The scholarship is ... impeccable."<b>--John Tyler Bonner, Princeton University</b></p>Janet Browne trained as a biologist, took her Ph.D. in the history of science, and has served as associate editor of <i>The Correspondence of Charles Darwin.</i> She is the author of several books and many scholarly papers.
